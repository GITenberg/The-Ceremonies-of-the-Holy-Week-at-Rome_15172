    <h2>DIRECTIONS</h2>

    <h3>FOR SEEING THE CEREMONIES</h3>
    <hr class="short" />

    <p>Provide yourself with a <b>Holy-Week-book</b>, or <i>Uffizio
    della Settimana Santa</i>. Take care that your dress is
    according to rule. For many of the ceremonies ladies require
    tickets signed by <i>M. Maggiordomo</i>.</p>

    <p>On Palm-sunday morning the Pontifical ceremonies begin at S.
    Peter's, at about 9 o'clock: no stranger can receive a palm
    without a permission signed by <i>M. Maggiordomo</i>. In the
    afternoon the Card. Penitentiary goes at about 4 or half past 4
    to S. John Lateran's, where the Station of the day is held.</p>

    <p>On the <i>afternoons</i> of <i>Wednesday</i> and
    <i>Thursday</i>, (between 4 and half past 4) and of
    <i>Friday</i> (half an hour sooner) the office of Tenebræ
    begins at the Sixtine chapel. After it is over, you may go to
    S. Peter's to bear the conclusion of a similar service: there
    on Thursday evening the high-altar is washed by the Card,
    priest and chapter; on Friday the Pope, Cardinals etc. go
    thither to venerate the relics after Tenebræ in the Sixtine
    chapel; and on the afternoons of both days the Card.
    Penitentiary goes thither in slate. In the evening of these
    three days the feet of pilgrims are washed, and they are served
    at table by Cardinals etc. at the Trinità dei Pellegrini.</p>

    <p>On <i>Thursday morning</i> you can see the oils blessed at
    S. Peter's: this ceremony begins <i>early</i>. There is little
    difference between the mass (at about half past 9 or 10) in the
    Sixtine chapel on this day, and on ordinary days, and there is
    generally a great crowd: the procession after mass is
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page4"
       id="page4"></a>[pg 4]</span> repeated on the following
       morning; and the papal benediction on Easter Sunday: your
       best plan therefore will be to go at an early hour to see
       the blessing of the oils, and afterwards the washing of the
       feet, at S. Peter's; and then go to see the dinner of the
       <i>apostles</i> near the balcony from which the Pope gives
       His benediction. The <i>Sepulchres</i>, particularly that in
       the Cappella Paolina, may be visited.</p>

    <p>On <i>Friday morning</i> the service of the Sixtine chapel
    begins at about half past 9 or 10. (Devotion of 3 hours' agony
    from about half past 12 to half past 3 at the Gesù, SS. Lorenzo
    e Damaso etc.; after the <i>Ave Maria</i> the <i>Via Crucis</i>
    at Caravita, and devotion of the dolours of the B. Virgin at S.
    Marcello, etc. An hour after the <i>Ave Maria</i> poetical
    compositions are recited at the Serbatojo dell'Arcadia).</p>

    <p>On <i>Saturday morning</i> service begins at S. John
    Lateran's at about half past 7. As soon you have seen the
    baptism at the baptistery, you had better drive to the Vatican,
    to attend at the beautiful mass of the Sixtine chapel.</p>

    <p>On <i>Saturday afternoon</i> you may go to the Armenian mass
    at S. Biagio or S. Gregorio Illuminatore: it begins towards 4 o
    clock. On Easter-Sunday the Pope sings solemn mass at S.
    Peter's, at about 9 o'clock. He afterwards venerates the
    relics, and gives His solemn benediction. In the afternoon,
    besides Vespers there is a procession at S. Peter's called that
    of the 3 Maries. (At S. John Lateran's the Cardinals assist at
    Vespers, and afterwards venerate the relics preserved there) At
    night the cupola is illuminated, and on the following night
    there are fireworks or <i>girandola</i> at Castle S. Angelo. On
    Monday, Tuesday, and Saturday there is <i>cappella papale</i>
    at the Vatican, but it differs little from the ordinary
    <i>cappelle</i>.</p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page5"

        Palmer, Origines Liturg. vol. I, p. 13.</p>
    </blockquote>

    <p class="side">Origin of the word ceremony.</p>

    <p>From Rome our Saxon forefathers received Christianity; and
    from the same source we have derived several words denoting
    Christian rites. Thus the words <i>religion, sacrament,
    sacrifice, communion</i>, and others are Latin, with the
    exception of the termination. The word <i>ceremony</i> also is
    Latin, and owes its origin to an interesting fact in ancient
    Roman history. When the Capitol was besieged by the Gauls (A.U.
    365) most of the inhabitants of Rome provided for their own
    safety by flight: but the Flamen Quirinalis or priest of
    Romulus, and the Vestal <span class="pagenum"><a name="page6"
       id="page6"></a>[pg 6]</span> virgins loaded themselves with
       the sacred things, that they might secure those hallowed
       treasures from profanation. "They were proceeding" (says
       Livy lib. V, c. XXII) "along the way which passes over the
       Sublician bridge, when they were met on the declivity by L.
       Albinus a plebeian, who was fleeing with his wife and
       children in a <i>plaustrum</i> or cart: he and his family
       immediately alighted: then placing in the cart the virgins
       and sacred things he accompanied them to Cære where they
       were received with hospitality and respect". Hence (says
       Valerius Maximus lib. I, c. 1.) "sacred things were called
       ceremonies, because the inhabitants of <i>Cære</i> revered
       them when the republic was broken, as readily as when it
       flourished". Thus is the word ceremony associated at once
       with the devotion of Albinus, with the Gaulish invasion of
       the Capitol, and with Cære, one of the twelve cities of
       Etruria, now called Cervetri or Cære
       vetus<a id="footnotetag1"
       name="footnotetag1"></a><a href="#footnote1"><sup>1</sup></a>.
       The Pagan Romans derived their religious rites from Etruria,
       and in particular from Cære on account of its proximity to
       Rome: this may be another reason for the adoption of the
       term <i>ceremony</i>, which was afterwards applied to the
       rites of all religions<a id="footnotetag2"
       name="footnotetag2"></a><a href="#footnote2"><sup>2</sup></a>.</p>

    <p class="side">Object of ceremonies.</p>

    <p>But what, it may be asked by many, is the use of ceremonies?
    I shall answer in the words of the council of
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page7"
       id="page7"></a>[pg 7]</span> Trent. "Since the nature of man
       is such, that he cannot easily without exterior helps be
       raised to the meditation of divine things, the church as a
       pious mother has instituted certain rites, namely, that some
       things in the mass should be pronounced in a low voice and
       others aloud; she has also used ceremonies, as mystical
       benedictions, lights, incense, vestments, and many other
       things of that kind, from apostolical tradition and
       discipline, in order that the majesty of so great a
       sacrifice might be displayed, and the minds of the faithful
       might be excited by these visible signs of religion and
       piety to the contemplation of those sublime things which are
       concealed in this sacrifice". Session XXII, c.
       V.&mdash;These words lead us to treat briefly of the mass,
       the principal act of divine worship during holy-week as at
       all other seasons of the year. This we do now the more
       readily, that we may not afterwards be obliged to interrupt
       our account of the peculiar ceremonies of Holy week, which
       presuppose an acquaintance with the mass.</p>

    <p class="side">Institution of the mass.</p>

    <p>Jesus Christ instituted the mass at his last supper, when he
    took bread and blessed and broke and gave to his disciples and
    said, Take ye and eat, this is my body; and taking the chalice
    he gave thanks, and gave to them saying, Drink ye all of this:
    For this is my blood of the new testament, which shall be shed
    for many unto remission of sins: Matth. XXVI, 26. In this brief
    account are mentioned all the <i>essential</i> parts of the
    mass. Christ commanded the apostles and through them their
    successors to perform the same holy rite "in commemoration" of
    Him, and they obeyed His commands, as we learn from the acts of
    the apostles, and the first epistle to the Corinthians.</p>

    <p class="side">Its early ceremonies.</p>

    <p>Gradually various prayers and ceremonies were added to the
    sacred words pronounced by Christ, as the Apology of St.
    Justin, the writings of St. Cyprian, the catechetical
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page8"
       id="page8"></a>[pg 8]</span> discourses of St. Cyril of
       Jerusalem and other early works prove. The Apostles
       themselves had added the Lord's prayer<a id="footnotetag3"
       name="footnotetag3"></a><a href="#footnote3"><sup>3</sup></a>.
       The liturgy however during the first four centuries, as Le
       Brun maintains<a id="footnotetag4"
       name="footnotetag4"></a><a href="#footnote4"><sup>4</sup></a>,
       or, according to Muratori followed by Palmer, the first
       three centuries, was not written, but was preserved by oral
       tradition, according to the received practice of the early
       church, which, unwilling to give what is holy to dogs, or to
       cast pearls before swine concealed from all persons, except
       the faithful, the mysteries of faith. It would seem from St.
       Justin's apology, that much was left to the particular
       devotion of the bishop or priest who offered mass, and hence
       we might expect not to find in the earliest liturgies great
       uniformity, except in essentials and general outline. Yet Le
       Brun has endeavoured to restore, from the early Christian
       writers, the liturgy used in the first four centuries: and
       it contains the most important prayers and ceremonies of the
       mass in its more modern form.</p>

    <p class="side">Discipline of secrecy.</p>

    <p>We shall so often have to recur to the discipline of secrecy
    alluded to above, that we consider it necessary to speak of it
    briefly, before we proceed further. The Pythagoreans, the
    Stoics, Plato, the Epicureans and other ancient philosophers
    concealed their doctrines from the uninitiated: the mysteries
    also of Osiris, Isis, Bacchus, Ceres, Cybele etc. were
    carefully kept secret. There was no novelty therefore for the
    ancients in the discipline of secrecy, the institution of which
    in the Christian church is attributed by many fathers to Christ
    himself, who directed that his disciples should not "give what
    is holy to dogs, or cast pearls before swine". Matt. VII, 6.
    This injunction <span class="pagenum"><a name="page9"
       id="page9"></a>[pg 9]</span> was observed by the whole
       church from the apostolic age till the fifth century in the
       east, and the sixth century in the west: it extended to
       dogmas as well as rites, and in particular to those of the
       holy Trinity and the sacraments, especially the blessed
       Eucharist<a id="footnotetag5"
       name="footnotetag5"></a><a href="#footnote5"><sup>5</sup></a>.
       For "those things" says St. Cyril of Alexandria "are
       generally derided, which are not understood" adv. Julianum.
       The pagans, at the instigation, it would appear, of the Jews
       and early heretics, availed themselves of this secret
       discipline to charge the Christians with the detestable
       crimes of Oedipus and Thyestes, pretending that in their
       secret assemblies they murdered an infant covered with
       flour, and drank his blood. (Cecilius ap. Minut. Fel.) It
       was solely with the view of refuting these calumnies, that
       Justin Martyr explained, in his apology addressed to
       Antoninus Pius, the catholic doctrine of the eucharist. S.
       Blandina on the contrary endured the most cruel torments
       rather than reveal it, though its profession would have
       confuted the same odious calumnies; and S. Augustine
       observes a similar reserve when answering the pagan Maximus
       Madaurensis.</p>

    <p>"Who" says the protestant Casaubon "is so little versed in
    the writings of the fathers, as to be ignorant of the formulary
    used principally of the sacraments, the initiated understand
    what is said: it occurs at least fifty times in Chrysostom, and
    almost as frequently in Augustine". S. Fulgentius inserts in
    his answer to the deacon Ferrandus the following words of S.
    Augustine to the neophytes "This which you see on the altar of
    God you saw last night: but what it was, what it meant, and of
    what a great thing it contains the sacrament, you have not yet
    heard. What therefore you see is bread and the chalice.
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page10"
       id="page10"></a>[pg 10]</span> What your faith demands is,
       that the bread is the body of Christ, and the chalice
       contains the blood of Christ". S. Cyril of Jerusalem in his
       catechetical discourses addressed to the newly baptised
       inculcates in the strongest terms the doctrine of the real
       presence, but charges them most strictly not to communicate
       to the catechumens his instructions. In consequence of this
       practice the early fathers often speak obscurely of the B.
       Sacrament, and call it bread and wine and <i>fermentum</i>
       after the consecration, though they clearly teach the
       <i>faithful</i> the doctrine of the real
       presence<a id="footnotetag6"
       name="footnotetag6"></a><a href="#footnote6"><sup>6</sup></a>.</p>

    <p class="side">Liturgy of the Roman church.</p>

    <p>Pope Innocent I, writing to Decentius at the beginning of
    the fifth century, attributes the liturgy of the Roman church
    to St. Peter. It was first written in the fifth century; and
    Pope Vigilius sending it in 538 to Profuturus derives it from
    Apostolic tradition. The most ancient sacramentary or
    liturgical work extant of the Roman church is that of Gelasius
    who was Pope from 492 to 496<a id="footnotetag7"
       name="footnotetag7"></a><a href="#footnote7"><sup>7</sup></a>.
       He collected prayers composed by more ancient authors, and
       also composed some himself: and this Gelasian compilation
       was reformed by Gregory the Great and reduced to one
       volume<a id="footnotetag8"
       name="footnotetag8"></a><a href="#footnote8"><sup>8</sup></a>,
       which may be considered as the prototype of our present
       liturgy. The canon or most
       <span class="pagenum"><a name="page11"
       id="page11"></a>[pg 11]</span> solemn part of the mass has
       been preserved inviolate ever since, as appears from the
       Ordines Romani written shortly after the time of S. Gregory,
       and also from the explanations of it written by Florus and
       Amalarius. This canon as well as the order of prayer are the
       same as those of Gelasius, as Palmer observes (Orig. liturg.
       vol. 1, p. 119,) and are also nearly identical with those of
       the sacramentary of S. Leo. The Ambrosian and African
       liturgies also were evidently derived at a very remote
       period from that of Rome. From such considerations as these
       Mr. Palmer proves the very ancient or apostolical origin of
       the "main order", the substance of the Roman liturgy.
       Origines liturg. vol. I, sect. VI. The author of the canon
       is unknown; yet we know the authors of some additions to the
       canon. Thus S. Leo I added sanctum sacrificium immaculatam
       hostiam, S. Gregory I, diesque nostros in tua pace
       disponas.</p>

    <p>We shall not examine minutely all the prayers and ceremonies

    each of them was first introduced, lest we should weary the

       but we shall content ourselves with a general review of the
       mass, as it is now celebrated. We may divide it, as the
       ancients <span class="pagenum"><a name="page12"
       id="page12"></a>[pg 12]</span> did, into two parts, the mass
       of the catechumens, and the mass of the faithful. The first
       part includes the preparation and confession of sins at the
       foot of the altar, the <i>introit</i> or anthem and part of
       a psalm sung at the <i>entrance</i> into church, the
       <i>Kyrie eleison</i> or petition for mercy, the <i>Gloria in
       excelsis</i> or hymn of praise (both of great antiquity, as
       Palmer following our catholic divines has shewn) the collect
       or collects so called from their being said when the people
       are collected together, the epistle and gospel, and also the
       verses, said or sung between them both, called the
       Gradual<a id="footnotetag10"
       name="footnotetag10"></a><a href="#footnote10"><sup>10</sup></a>:
       if sung by one voice, it is called the Tract; if by choir,
       the Responsory. The collects and other prayers are said with
       the arms extended in the same manner as many figures are
       represented praying on old christian as well as pagan
       monuments. After the gospel the sermon used to be preached,
       as it generally is in our times<a id="footnotetag11"
       name="footnotetag11"></a><a href="#footnote11"><sup>11</sup></a>
       and after the sermon Pagans, Jews, heretics, schismatics,
       energumens, public penitents and catechumens were dismissed
       by the deacon; for the faithful alone were allowed to be
       present at the celebration of the sacred mysteries, in
       conformity to the discipline of secrecy. That part of mass,
       which we have described was called the mass of the
       catechumens, because these were allowed to be present at
       it.</p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page13"
       id="page13"></a>[pg 13]</span>

    <p class="side">Mass of the faithful, blessed water.</p>

    <p>From the <i>missio</i>, <i>missa</i>, or dismissal announced
    by the deacon to the people before and after the mass of the
    faithful, the term <i>missa</i> or mass is derived. It was in
    use in the early ages; for it is found not only in the epistle
    to the bishop of Vienne attributed to Pope Pius I, and in that
    of Pope Cornelius to Lupicinus: but S. Ambrose also says "I
    continued my duty, and began to celebrate mass" and in another
    place he exhorts the people to "hear mass
    daily<a id="footnotetag12"
       name="footnotetag12"></a><a href="#footnote12"><sup>12</sup></a>".</p>

    <p>When the church had been cleared of all except the faithful,
    the second part of our mass, or the mass of the faithful, began
    with the Nicene symbol or creed. Then followed the offertory,
    or part of a psalm sung anciently while the people made their
    offerings to the church, <span class="pagenum"><a name="page14"
       id="page14"></a>[pg 14]</span> particularly of bread and
       wine<a id="footnotetag13"
       name="footnotetag13"></a><a href="#footnote13"><sup>13</sup></a>.
       The priest offers to God the bread, and wine mixed according
       to apostolic tradition<a id="footnotetag14"
       name="footnotetag14"></a><a href="#footnote14"><sup>14</sup></a>
       with a little water, which our Saviour is believed to have
       mixed with the wine at the last supper; he implores God's
       blessing on these offerings, and washes his hands in token
       of the purity of soul<a id="footnotetag15"
       name="footnotetag15"></a><a href="#footnote15"><sup>15</sup></a>
       with which the sacred mysteries should be approached, and at
       high mass for the sake of outward cleanliness also, on
       account of the incense which he has used. Having
       commemorated the passion, resurrection, and ascension of
       Christ, as he does also after the consecration, he calls on
       those present to join him in prayer, he says another prayer
       or prayers called the <i>secret</i>, because said in secret,
       and then recites the <i>preface</i> to the canon, a prayer
       in which he unites with the celestial spirits in praise and
       thanksgiving as Christ himself gave thanks at the last
       supper: it concludes with the Tersanctus or Trisagion "Holy,
       Holy, Holy etc." which, as Palmer observes, has been
       probably used in the Christian liturgy of the east and west
       since the ages of the apostles. V. 2. p. 219.</p>

    <p class="side">Prayers for the dead.</p>

    <p>The canon of the mass next follows, which as well as many of
    the preceding and following prayers is said in a low voice,
    according to the ancient custom alluded to
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page15"
       id="page15"></a>[pg 15]</span> by Innocent I, S. Augustine,
       Origen, and other Fathers<a id="footnotetag16"
       name="footnotetag16"></a><a href="#footnote16"><sup>16</sup></a>.
       In it the priest prays for the church, the Pope, the bishop
       of the place, the living and the dead<a id="footnotetag17"
       name="footnotetag17"></a><a href="#footnote17"><sup>17</sup></a>
       he reveres the <span class="pagenum"><a name="page16"
       id="page16"></a>[pg 16]</span> memory of the B. Virgin, the
       Martyrs and other Saints<a id="footnotetag18"
       name="footnotetag18"></a><a href="#footnote18"><sup>18</sup></a>,
       and having once more implored the blessing of God, and
       spread his hands over the victim, according to the custom of
       the Jews, he pronounces over the bread and wine the words of
       consecration according to the command of Christ, and adores
       and raises for the adoration of the people the body and
       blood of our Divine Lord. It is in this consecration that
       the sacrifice of the mass principally consists; as by it the
       victim is placed on the altar, and offered to God, viz.
       Christ himself, represented as dead by the separate
       consecration of the bread and wine, as if His blood were
       separated from His body. After some other prayers, in which
       the priest offers to God the holy sacrifice, and prays for
       mercy and salvation for all present, he elevates the host
       and chalice together; this was the ancient elevation, as the
       more solemn one, which follows immediately after the
       consecration, was introduced generally in the 12th century,
       in opposition to the heresy of Berengarius. Then concluding
       the canon the priest recites the <i>Our Father</i>, and
       breaks the host, as Christ broke the bread, and as His body
       was "broken" for us<a id="footnotetag19"
       name="footnotetag19"></a><a href="#footnote19"><sup>19</sup></a>;
       he puts a particle of the
       <span class="pagenum"><a name="page17"
       id="page17"></a>[pg 17]</span> host into the
       chalice<a id="footnotetag20"
       name="footnotetag20"></a><a href="#footnote20"><sup>20</sup></a>;
       he implores mercy and peace from the lamb of God, at solemn
       masses gives the kiss of peace according to the
       recommendation of scripture, and receives the two ablutions
       of the chalice, one of wine, the other of wine and water,
       lest any portion of the sacred blood should remain in it: he
       recites the communion or anthem, which was originally sung
       while the holy communion was distributed; he says the prayer
       or prayers called postcommunion, dismisses and begs God's
       blessing on the people, in fine he recites the beginning of
       St. John's gospel or some other gospel appropriate to the
       day. We shall on other occasions recur to various ceremonies
       of the mass<a id="footnotetag21"
       name="footnotetag21"></a><a href="#footnote21"><sup>21</sup></a>.</p>

    <p class="side">Latin the language of the liturgy.</p>

    <p>The language of our liturgy has descended to us as a
    precious legacy from the time when Peter and Paul preached in
    Rome. It would be incongruous that our ancient hierarchy robed
    in ancient vestments should perform our ancient liturgy in a
    moderne language. As in all parts of the globe there are
    members of the Catholic church, she has wisely preserved in her
    liturgy a language common to all countries, the language too of
    majesty, civilisation and science, as De Maistre observes. Like
    her divine founder <span class="pagenum"><a name="page18"
       id="page18"></a>[pg 18]</span> she is the same yesterday and
       to-day: like the rock, on which she is built, she is proof
       against the winds and waves; she is unchanged and unaffected
       by the wayward caprices of fashion. Translations of her
       liturgy are published for the use of those who are
       unacquainted with Latin so that they may either join in
       reciting the prayers of the church, or say others which
       their own devotion may suggest.</p>

    <p>Having described the ceremonies of low-mass, we shall
    subjoin a brief account of those customary at high-mass when
    celebrated in the papal chapel: we shall thus avoid unnecessary
    repetitions in the course of this work. The beginning of the
    mass is said by all persons within the sanctuary: and the Pope
    recites it before the altar with the celebrant. As His Holiness
    is the ecclesiastical superior of the latter, and is habited in
    his sacred vestments, many benedictions are, according to a
    general rubric, reserved to Him, which are otherwise given by
    the person who sings mass. Thus He blesses not only the
    incense, the water at the offertory, the subdeacon and deacon,
    the preacher, when there is a sermon, and the people after the
    sermon and at the end of mass, but also the Cardinals on
    several occasions, and the celebrant himself before he offers
    up mass. "For without contradiction (says St. Paul) that which
    is less is blessed by the better". Hebr. VII, 7. He also, and
    not the celebrant, kisses the book of the Gospel. The first
    cardinal priest present hands to Him the incense, and also
    incenses him, kneeling down if the Pope be seated at the time,
    and standing if the Pope stands<a id="footnotetag22"
       name="footnotetag22"></a><a href="#footnote22"><sup>22</sup></a>,
       <span class="pagenum"><a name="page19"
       id="page19"></a>[pg 19]</span> and therefore, he is seated
       near the Pope during part of the Mass, that he may be ready
       when his services are required.</p>

    <p>Incense is used, as is customary at high masses, before the
    introit, at the Gospel, after the offertory and during the
    elevation. Before the introit the crucifix, the
    altar<a id="footnotetag23"
       name="footnotetag23"></a><a href="#footnote23"><sup>23</sup></a>,
       the celebrant and the Pope are successively incensed. Before
       the deacon sings the gospel he incenses the book; and after
       it the Pope is once more incensed by the first cardinal
       priest. After the offertory, besides the bread and wine, the
       crucifix, the altar, the celebrant and the Pope, the
       Cardinals and the first in rank among the prelates and other
       personages are incensed by the deacon. At the elevation the
       blessed Sacrament alone is incensed.<a id="footnotetag24"
       name="footnotetag24"></a><a href="#footnote24"><sup>24</sup></a></p><span class="pagenum">
    <a name="page20"
       id="page20"></a>[pg 20]</span>

    <p>When the Pope reads from the missal, this book is held by
    the first, and a taper by the second, patriarch or assisting
    bishop<a id="footnotetag25"
       name="footnotetag25"></a><a href="#footnote25"><sup>25</sup></a>.
       The <i>Kyrie eleison</i>, the <i>Gloria in excelsis</i>,
       <i>Credo</i>, <i>Sanctus</i> and <i>Agnus Dei</i> are said
       by all persons within the sanctuary: the cardinals descend
       from their seats to say them, and form a circle in the
       middle of the chapel; having received the Pope's blessing
       they return to their places. After the <i>Sanctus</i>, the
       Pope goes before the middle of the altar followed by the
       assistant bishops and others of His train's and all kneel
       till the elevation is ended. After the <i>Agnus Dei</i>, the
       first Card. priest goes up to the altar, kisses it, and
       receives from the celebrant the kiss of peace: this he gives
       to the Pope, from whom the two first Card. deacons receive
       it. The Card. priest then returns to his place, and gives
       the kiss of peace to the priest who assists the celebrant;
       from him the first of the other cardinals and principal
       prelates receive it and communicate it to their colleagues.
       The assistant priest then gives it to the master of
       ceremonies, who has accompanied him, from whom the other
       colleges of prelates receive it and in fine (if time permit)
       to the deacon, from whom it passes to others who assist at
       the altar. When the pope gives His blessing, the cross is
       held before Him by the last auditor of the rota, and His
       vestment by the first protonary. Such are the ceremonies
       generally observed at high mass in the papal chapel, except
       at masses for the dead, when some of them, and in particular
       those of incensing (except at the offertory and elevation)
       and of the kiss of peace, are
       omitted.</p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page21"

    <p class="side">Sentiments of S. John Chrysostom.</p>

    <p>We shall conclude with the words of a holy and eloquent
    bishop of Costantinople of the 4th century, "When thou seest
    the Lord immolated and placed there, and the priest engaged in
    the sacrifice and praying, and all present empurpled with
    precious blood, dost thou think that thou art among men, and
    art standing on the earth? and not rather that thou art
    instantaneously transferred to heaven, where casting out of thy
    soul every fleshly thought thou lookest around on heavenly
    things. O miracle! O the love of God for man! He, who sits
    above with the Father, is at the same time held in the hands of
    all, and gives himself to those who wish to receive and embrace
    him. Wishest thou to see the excellence of this <i>holiness</i>
    from another miracle? Depict before thy eyes Elias and an
    innumerable multitude surrounding him, and the victim placed on
    the stones; all the others in profound silence, and the prophet
    alone praying; then suddenly fire rushing from heaven on the
    sacrifice. These things are astonishing and replete with
    wonder. Then transfer thyself thence to the things now
    effected, and thou wilt find them not only wonderful, but
    surpassing all astonishment. For here the priest bears not
    fire, but the holy Ghost; he pours out long supplications, not
    that fire descending from above may consume the offerings, but
    that grace falling on the sacrifice may through it inflame the
    souls of all and render them purer than silver purified by
    fire. This most dread rite then who, that is not altogether
    insane and out of his mind, shall be able to contemn? Art thou
    ignorant that no human soul could have sustained this fire of
    the victim, but all would have totally perished, unless the
    assistance of divine grace had been abundant" S. John
    Chrysostom, De Sacerdotio Lib. 3, c. IV.</p>

        similar account of the Roman liturgy. They, like archbishop
        Wake, attribute the origin of the Roman, Oriental, Ethiopic
        and Mozarabic liturgies to St. Peter, St. James, St. Mark
        and St. John, and observe that all other liturgies are
        copied from one or other of these. "In each of these four
        original liturgies the eucharist is regarded as a mystery
        and as a sacrifice" p. 395: they all agree in the principal
        ceremonies of the mass, and all contain a prayer for the
        rest and peace of all those who have departed this life in
        God's faith and fear" p. 393. "Now it may be reasonably
        presumed", says archbishop Wake "that those passages
        wherein all these liturgies agree, in sense at least, if
        not in words, were first prescribed in the writings of the
        ancient fathers". See Tracts for the times, no. 63.</p>

        <i>ambo</i> or pulpit, according to Rabanus Maurus an
        author of the 9th century, and others. In the ancient
        churches there were generally in the <i>chorus</i> or choir
        two ambones, one from which at solemn masses the lector and
        at a later period the subdeacon used to sing the gospel,

        1100. It has for a long time been customary to remove it
        before the gospel, which the priest recites turned towards
        the same direction as the deacon at high mass. Mystical
        meanings were afterwards assigned for this removal of the
        book.</p>

        <p>It is astonishing how Mr. Palmer could assert that "Leo
        bishop of Rome in the fifth century appears to have been
        the only bishop who preached in the Roman church for many
        Footnote: and it is said that none of his successors until
        the time of Pius the fifth, five hundred years afterwards,
        imitated his example". Orig. Liturg. vol. II, p. 59.
        Bingham I. IV, c. §.3. Mr. Palmer forgot all the homilies
        of Gregory the great, as well as the chronology of the
        Popes. The latter might find in the multiplicity and
        importance of their other occupations abundant motives for
        abstaining from preaching, a duty to which so many of their
        clergy dedicate themselves. That the early Popes however
        preached there can be no doubt, although most of their
        homilies, if ever written, have not reached our time. Not
        only the example of S. Peter who (whatever we may think of
        the local tradition of Rocca S. Pietro above Palestrina)
        used certainly to preach, as the Acts of the Apostles
        prove; but the general custom of other cities would induce
        the zealous Bishops of Rome to exhort and encourage their
        flock, particularly in time of persecution; and that at a
        later period they were not unaccustomed to preach is
        evident from the Ordo Romanus of Card. Gaetano published by
        Mabillon and from a Vatican MS. no. 4231, p. 197; both
        these documents are quoted by Cancellieri, <i>Descriz.
        delle Cappelle etc. p. 328</i>. See proofs that the Popes
        preached drawn up in chronological order in Sala's notes to
        Card. Bona, lib. 2. c. 7-</p>

        <p>As the ancient Roman houses had an <i>impluvium</i> in
        the midst of the <i>atrium</i>, so in the <i>atria</i>
        annexed to the Christian churches was one or more fountains
        (Eus. Eccl. Hist. l. X, c. 4) and sometimes a well or
        cistern. In these the faithful used to wash their hands
        (Tertull. De orat. §, De lavat. man.) Thus in the atrium of

        mention what words Christ used, when He "gave thanks",
        before He pronounced the words of consecration; and the
        early church imitated this reserve. Anciently curtains
        concealed the altar, during the most solemn part of mass,
        as now in some Oriental churches. St. John Chrysostom (Hom.

        also in the well-known works on the catacombs. Bingham
        admits that the eucharistic sacrifice was offered for S.
        Augustine, S. Monica, the emperors Constantine and
        Valentinian at their funerals. (S. Ambrose prayed for
        Valentinian Gratian and Theodosius.) "In the communion

        for the faithful departed most evidently appears to have
        prevailed in the church even from the time of the
        apostles", says the Protestant bishop Milles, Opera S.
        Cyrilli. p. 297. "In primitive times" says Palmer "these
        commemorations (in the mass) were accompanied by prayers
        for the departed". Origin. Liturg. vol. 2, p. 94. With
        these Protestant admissions before us and many others
        collected in the Annali delle Scienze Relig. Luglio 1839,
        we opine that the Rev. Mr. Breeks ought to have been
        solicitous for his own soul rather than for that of Mrs.
        Wolfrey, whose inscription was dictated by the spirit of
        primitive Christianity. The following is the inscription on

        <p>Macri in his Hierolexicon says, that the Cardinal
        kneels, to incense the Pope when seated, from respect to
        his <i>cattedra</i> or chair, which is the first see in the
        Christian church. Others say from respect to his temporal
        sovereignty, the archbishops of Milan are incensed with the
        same formality. This custom is mentioned in the 13th
        century by Card. Giaconio Gaetano. Ordo Romanus § 112. A
        certain love of proportion may have had its share in the
        origin of this ceremony, by which the same relative height
        is preserved between the Pope and the Cardinal in all cases
        in which the former is incensed. Thus also the assistant
        Bishop, who holds the Missal for the Pope, kneels when He
        is seated, and stands when He stands. We kneel to the Pope
        to receive his blessing, as we do to bishops and even
        priests; we also kneel from respect to his exalted dignity,
        not only as sovereign, but also as head of the Catholic
        church. It is well known that the British peers kneel even
        to the empty throne of their sovereign. Kneeling is a very
        ancient token of profound respect; it was paid to Joseph in
        Egypt, Gen. XLI, 43; to Elias, 4 Kings I, 13 etc.</p>

        <p>Incense is, as we shall see in c. 2; an emblem of
        prayer, and in this sense it is offered to the B.
        Sacrament, to Christ represented by the crucifix, and
        adored on the altar. The gospel is incensed to signify the
        sweet odour which it communicates to our souls; and the
        ministers of God, to signify, according to St. Thomas, that
        God maketh manifest <i>the odour</i> of his knowledge by us
        in every place: "For we are unto God <i>the good odour</i>
        of Christ in them who are saved, and in them who perish". 2
        Cor. II, 14, 15. In fine the bread and wine offered to God
        are incensed to signify the spices with which the body of
        Christ was embalmed in the tomb; such at least is the
        explanation given in the Liturgy of St. Chrysostom; and it
        is from the oriental churches that the Latin church has
        taken this last practice. Incense is a token of respect in
        these and other cases.</p>

    <p class="side">P. I. Holy-week</p>

    <p>The sufferings and death of Jesus Christ are the mysteries
    which the catholic church commemorates during holy week. "On
    these days" says S. John Chrysostom (in Ps. CXCIV) "was the
    tyranny of the devil overthrown, sin and its curse were taken
    away, heaven was opened and made accessible". It was then
    becoming that christians should consecrate these days of mercy,
    of grace and <span class="pagenum"><a name="page23"
       id="page23"></a>[pg 23]</span> salvation to exercises of
       penance, devotion, and thanksgiving. The imposing liturgy of
       the Roman church is at this season more than usually solemn;
       and it is our task to describe, and endeavour to trace to
       their origin, its varied ceremonies.</p>

    <p class="side">Palm-Sunday, Christ's entry into Jerusalem.</p>

    <p>Palm-sunday is so called from the commemoration of our
    blessed Saviour's entry into Jerusalem, when, according to St.
    John (XII, 13) "a great multitude took branches of palm-trees,
    and went forth to meet him, and cried: "Hosanna, blessed is he
    that cometh in the name of the Lord". Thus when Simon Maccabee
    subdued Jerusalem, he entered it "with thanksgiving and
    branches of palm-trees, and harps, and cymbals, and hymns and
    canticles, because the great enemy was destroyed out of
    Israel". 1 Macc. XIII. The entry of our divine Redeemer
    therefore was one of triumph: but it was also the entry of a
    king into his capital: for "many spread their garments in the
    way" (Mark XI, 8), as when Jehu was elected king, (4 Kings IX,
    13), the Israelites spread their garments under his feet. Thus
    also Plutarch relates of Cato of Utica, that the soldiers
    regretting the expiration of his authority with many tears and
    embraces spread their garments, where he passed on foot.</p>

    <p>Pope Julius II returning to Rome after the siege of
    Mirandola distributed palms to the Roman court at S. Maria del
    Popolo; and then rode in triumphal procession to the Vatican
    passing under seven arches adorned with representations of his
    extraordinary and heroic deeds<a id="footnotetag26"
       name="footnotetag26"></a><a href="#footnote26"><sup>26</sup></a>.</p>

    <p class="side">Sixtus V and Captain Bresca.</p>

    <p>When Sixtus V. undertook to erect in the Piazza di San
    Pietro the ponderous egyptian obelisk<a id="footnotetag27"
       name="footnotetag27"></a><a href="#footnote27"><sup>27</sup></a>,
       which formerly <span class="pagenum"><a name="page24"
       id="page24"></a>[pg 24]</span> adorned Nero's circus at the
       Vatican, he forbade on pain of death that any one should
       speak lest the attention of the workmen should be taken off
       from their arduous task. A naval officer of S. Remo, who
       happened to be present, foreseeing that the ropes would take
       fire, cried out "<i>acqua alle funi</i>". He was immediately
       arrested by the Swiss guards, as we see him represented in
       the small fresco in the Vatican library, and was conducted
       before the Pontiff. Sixtus shewed that his severity was
       based on justice; for instead of punishing the transgressor
       of his orders, he offered him the choice of his own reward.
       They who have observed the great abundance of palms which
       grow in the neighbourhood of S. Remo, on the coast between
       Nice and Genoa, will not be surprised to hear, that the
       first wish of the gallant captain was to enjoy the privilege
       of supplying the pontifical chapel with palms. The Pope
       granted him this exclusive right and it is still enjoyed by
       one of his family.</p>

    <p class="side">Return of Pius VII to Rome.</p>

    <p>When the meek and benevolent Pius VII was returning to Rome
    from exile and captivity, Dr. Bresca, one of the captain's
    descendants, contrived, though not without great risk, to
    convey to Rome the choicest palms of S. Remo and Bordighera. At
    the house of his friend Viale half a mile outside the Porta del
    Popolo, he assembled twenty five <i>orfanelli</i> dressed in
    their white cassocks, and forty-five <i>verginelle</i>. When
    the carriage of the beloved Pontiff approached, this double
    choir of children appeared, bearing palms in their hands and
    singing joyous canticles of benediction but I must describe
    this lovely scene in the melodious language of the south.
    "Ciascuno di essi (says Cancellieri) recava in mano una di
    queste palme di color d'oro altissime e cadenti come tante
    vaghissime piume. Sei zitelle sostenevano de'galanti panieri di
    freschissimi fiori pendenti dal loro collo, con nastri bianchi
    e gialli, relativi allo stendardo Pontificio. Quindi tutti si
    schierarono in buon <span class="pagenum"><a name="page25"
       id="page25"></a>[pg 25]</span> ordine sulle due ale delta
       strada, e mentre le ragazze versavano graziosamente a mani
       piene da' loro canestrelli la verzura ed i fiori, quella
       selva ondeggiante di palme, tributate al trionfo del S.
       Padre dal candore e dall' innocenza, sorprese con la novità
       di uno spettacolo, che non potè a meno d'intenerire, e di
       muovere tutti gli astanti".</p>

    <p>If we now look back for a moment to the triumphs of the
    pagan emperors, well may we bless God for the change which the
    religion of Christ has wrought in this city. After they had let
    loose war, and famine, and pestilence, to prey upon hapless
    nations, they ascended the Capitol to offer incense with
    polluted hands to their profane gods; and meantime the groans
    of the dying and unpitied princes, whom they had reserved to
    decorate their triumph, ascended from the scala Gemonia to call
    down the vengeance of heaven upon their oppressors. But while
    the pacific and holy vicar of Christ returns in triumph to his
    capital, the lips of babes and sucklings sing his praises, as
    they did those of his Divine Master, and he implores heaven to
    shower down benedictions on his enemies as well as his beloved
    children.</p>

    <p class="side">P. II Papal chapel on palm-sunday.</p>

    <p class="side">Lights used at mass, etc.</p>

    <p>At about 9 o'clock on palm-sunday morning the Cardinals,
    Prelates and others assemble near the chapel of the Pieta at S.
    Peter's, as at present the solemn service takes place in that
    basilica, and not as formerly in the Sixtine chapel. The
    crucifix over the altar is veiled, in token of the mourning of
    the church over her divine spouse's
    sufferings<a id="footnotetag28"
       name="footnotetag28"></a><a href="#footnote28"><sup>28</sup></a>.
       On the altar are six lighted candles, and other torches are
       brought in after the <i>Sanctus</i> of the Mass,
       <span class="pagenum"><a name="page26"
       id="page26"></a>[pg 26]</span> and held till after the
       elevation, in honour of the B. Sacrament, by four <i>acoliti
       ceroferarii</i><a id="footnotetag29"
       name="footnotetag29"></a><a href="#footnote29"><sup>29</sup></a>.</p>

    <p class="side">sacred vestments</p>

    <p>As the pope is to bless and distribute the palms, and a
    solemn procession is to take place, the Cardinals put on their
    sacred vestments, viz. all of them the amice, the cardinal
    bishops the surplice and the cope, the priests the chasuble,
    and the deacons a chasuble shorter in front than that of the
    priests. The auditors of the Rota, <i>Cherici di Camera,
    Votanti</i>, and <i>Abbreviatori</i> put on a <i>cotta</i> or
    supplice. The bishops and mitred abbots wear the cope, and the
    <i>Penitenzieri</i> or confessors of St. Peter's, the chasuble.
    The copes of the cardinal bishops are ornamented with a
    <i>formale</i>, adorned with three large bosses or projections
    of pearls arranged in a perpendicular line, while the Pope's
    are in a triangular order, evidently alluding, to the blessed
    Trinity. As this is a day of mourning, the sacred vestments are
    purple.</p>

    <p class="side"><i>ubbidienza.</i></p>

    <p>Thus attired and holding their mitres the Cardinals remain
    standing while the Pope is vested by the assistant
    Cardinal-deacons who put on His Holiness the amice, alb,
    girdle, stole, red cope, <i>formale</i> or clasp, and mitre.
    All then move in procession towards the high-altar in the order
    observed in the procession of the palms, as described
    below:<a id="footnotetag30"
       name="footnotetag30"></a><a href="#footnote30"><sup>30</sup></a>
       the Pope descends from His <i>sedia gestatoria</i> to adore
       the Holy Sacrament with the Cardinals etc. The
       <span class="pagenum"><a name="page27"
       id="page27"></a>[pg 27]</span> procession then goes to the
       high-altar; and having prayed for a short time before it,
       the Pope goes to the throne,<a id="footnotetag31"
       name="footnotetag31"></a><a href="#footnote31"><sup>31</sup></a>
       and there receives the <i>ubbidienza</i> or homage of all
       the cardinals present, who in turn kiss His right hand
       covered with the cope. This ceremony which takes place at
       all solemn offices, except on good friday, and at masses for
       the dead, bears some resemblance to the old homage of feudal
       times<a id="footnotetag32"
       name="footnotetag32"></a><a href="#footnote32"><sup>32</sup></a>.</p>

    <p class="side">Blessing of the palms.</p>

    <p>Some palms are arranged on the altar. The Pope's chief
    Sacristan, who is a bishop chosen from the Augustinian order
    bears one, and kneels on the steps of the throne between the
    deacon and subdeacon, who bear two larger palms. His Holiness
    reads the usual prayers over the palms, sprinkles them with
    holy water, and incenses them three
    times.</p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page28"
       id="page28"></a>[pg 28]</span>

    <p class="side">Distribution of the palms.</p>

    <p>When the palms have been blessed<a id="footnotetag33"
       name="footnotetag33"></a><a href="#footnote33"><sup>33</sup></a>,
       the Cardinal Dean receives from the governor of Rome and
       presents to the Pope those three palms, which were borne by
       <i>M. Sagrista</i>, the deacon and subdeacon. One of these
       is held during the service by the prince assistant at the
       throne, the other two are delivered to the care of <i>M.
       Coppiere</i>, one of the <i>Camerieri segreti
       partecipanti</i>: the shortest is carried
       <span class="pagenum"><a name="page29"
       id="page29"></a>[pg 29]</span> by the Pope in the
       procession. An embroidered apron is now placed over the
       Pope's knees, and the cardinals in turn receive a palm from
       Him, kissing the palm, his right hand and knee. The bishops
       present kiss the palm which they receive and his right knee:
       and the mitred abbots and <i>Penitenzieri</i> kiss the palm
       and his foot<a id="footnotetag34"
       name="footnotetag34"></a><a href="#footnote34"><sup>34</sup></a>,
       as do all who come after them in the following order, which
       is observed also on good-friday at the kissing of the cross,
       and it is also on candlemas-day and ash-wednesday.</p>

    <p>The Governor, the Prince assistant, the <i>Uditore della
    Camera</i>, the Treasurer, the <i>Maggiordomo</i>, the
    Apostolic protonotaries; the Generals of Religious Orders, the
    <i>Conservatori</i> and Prior of the <i>Caporioni</i>, the
    <i>Maestro del S. Ospizio</i>, the <i>Uditori di Rota</i>, the
    <i>Maestro del S. Palazzo</i>, the <i>Votanti di Segnatura</i>,
    the <i>Abbreviatori del Parco maggiore</i>, the priest, deacon,

    Collegio</i>, the singers, the clerks of the papal chapel, the
    cardinal's <i>caudatarii</i>, the <i>ostiarii</i>, the
    mace-bearers, some students of the German college, and in fine
    such noblemen and gentlemen as are admitted on this occasion to
    receive a palm from His Holiness, who is assisted as usual by
    two Card. deacons.</p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page30"
       id="page30"></a>[pg 30]</span>

    <p>During the distribution of the palms, the anthems <i>Pueri
    Hebræorum</i> etc. are sung by the choir; and when it is
    finished, the Pope washes His hands, and says the usual
    concluding prayer: the prince stationed at the throne brings
    the water, and the Cardinal Dean presents the towel to His
    Holiness.</p>

    <p class="side"><i>Solemn procession.</i></p>

    <p>The Pope then puts incense into the thurible for the
    procession, and the first Card. Deacon turning towards the
    people says according to the old formula Let us proceed in
    peace: the choir answers, in the name of Christ. Amen'. The
    procession, in which the blessed palms are carried, moves round
    S. Peter's, in the following order, which is observed also for
    the most part on holy thursday and good friday. The
    <i>Procuratori di Collegio</i>,<a id="footnotetag35"
       name="footnotetag35"></a><a href="#footnote35"><sup>35</sup></a>
       <i>Procuratori generali</i>, the <i>Bussolanti</i>, the
       <i>Ajutanti di Camera</i>, <i>Cappellani comuni</i> and
       <i>segreti</i>, the Consistorial advocates, the <i>Camerieri

       <i>Abbreviatori, Votanti di Segnatura, Cherici di Camera,
       Uditori di Rota</i>, the Thurifer, (<i>Votante di
       Segnatura</i>), the Subdeacon (<i>Uditore di Rota</i>) who
       carries the cross ornamented with a small palm, between two
       acolythes (<i>Votanti di Segnatura</i>) carrying candles,
       the <i>Penitenzieri</i>, the mitred abbots, bishops and the
       Cardinal deacons, priests and bishops all wearing their
       mitres.<a id="footnotetag36"
       name="footnotetag36"></a><a href="#footnote36"><sup>36</sup></a>
       The Pope is preceded by many officers of his guards (who go
       to the throne towards the end of the distribution of palms),
       the <i>Maestro del S. Ospizio</i>, the <i>Conservatori</i>,
       Senator and Governor of Rome. His Holiness is carried on his
       <i>Sedia gestatoria</i><a id="footnotetag37"
       name="footnotetag37"></a><a href="#footnote37"><sup>37</sup></a>
       under a canopy supported
       <span class="pagenum"><a name="page31"
       id="page31"></a>[pg 31]</span> by 8 <i>Referendarii</i>
       (prelates of the tribunal of <i>Segnatura</i>) between the
       <i>flabelli</i> carried by two of His <i>Camerieri</i>. He
       is followed by the dean of the Rota (whose duty it is to
       bear His mitre) between two <i>camerieri segreti</i> (who as
       well as two Auditors of the Rota bear His train when
       occasion requires), by the <i>Uditore della Camera</i>, the
       Treasurer, <i>Maggiordomo</i>, Protonotaries and Generals of
       religious orders.</p>

    <p>During the procession the choir sings the anthem, <i>Cum
    appropinquaret etc.</i> When the procession is in the portico,
    two soprano singers reenter the basilica, and shut the door:
    then turning towards the door, they sing the first verse of the
    hymn <i>Gloria, laus et honor</i><a id="footnotetag38"
       name="footnotetag38"></a><a href="#footnote38"><sup>38</sup></a>
       and the other verses alternately with the choir, which
       remains without. The <span class="pagenum"><a name="page32"
       id="page32"></a>[pg 32]</span> subdeacon knocks at the gate
       with the cross, and it is immediately opened; the procession
       returns into the church, and the choir sings the concluding
       anthems.</p>

    <p class="side"><i>its antiquity.</i></p>

    <p>The solemn commemoration, which we have described, of
    Christ's triumphant entry into Jerusalem, could never have
    taken place during times of persecution: nor did it originate
    immediately after Constantine had ensured peace to the church.
    Martene (De ant. Eccl. Rit. lib. IV, c. 20) could find no
    mention of it before the 8th or 9th century, when Amalarius
    says "In memory of this we are accustomed to carry
    palm-branches, and cry Hosanna". Merati however, in his notes
    to Gavant, considers that he has found traces of it in the
    Gregorian and Gelasian sacramentaries, and in a Roman calendar
    of the beginning of the fifth century<a id="footnotetag39"
       name="footnotetag39"></a><a href="#footnote39"><sup>39</sup></a>
       and his opinion is adopted by Benedict XIV. The ceremonies
       of the church of Jerusalem on this day were a still closer
       imitation of the entry of Christ into that city.</p>

    <p>When the procession is ended, the cardinals, bishops, and
    mitred abbots take off their sacred vestments and the prelates
    their surplices, and they all resume their respective
    <i>cappe</i>; the <i>Penitenzieri</i> retire, and mass is
    celebrated by a cardinal of the order of priests. Having
    already given an account not only of low mass, but also of the
    additional ceremonies of high mass, as celebrated in the papal
    chapel, we shall here mention those only which are peculiar to
    palm-sunday.</p>

    <p>At those words of the epistle (which is sung as usual by the
    subdeacon), "in the name of Jesus let every knee bow", the
    whole assembly kneels to adore their divine Redeemer, who
    became obedient unto death for our salvation. The affecting
    account of His sufferings and death
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page33"
       id="page33"></a>[pg 33]</span> is then sung by three
       priests<a id="footnotetag40"
       name="footnotetag40"></a><a href="#footnote40"><sup>40</sup></a>
       belonging to the pontifical choir, and habited as deacons in
       alb and stole. The history itself is sung by a tenor voice,
       the words, of our Saviour by a bass, and those of any other
       single voice by a <i>contralto</i>, called the
       <i>ancilla</i>, as he sings the words of the <i>maid</i> to
       S. Peter: the choir sings the words of the
       multitude<a id="footnotetag41"
       name="footnotetag41"></a><a href="#footnote41"><sup>41</sup></a>.
       The church, mourning over the sufferings of her divine
       Spouse, does not allow the incense, lights, or the
       benediction and salutation usual before the gospel; but the
       palms are borne to signify the triumphs consequent on His
       death as they are also from the elevation till after the
       communion. All stand up as usual from respect to the holy
       gospel ("as servants before their Lord" Amalarius) but kneel
       for a short time at the words "Jesus crying with a loud
       voice yielded up the ghost", to adore that God of love who
       died for mankind. The latter part of the gospel is sung in
       the usual chant by the deacon, but without the customary
       lights<a id="footnotetag42"
       name="footnotetag42"></a><a href="#footnote42"><sup>42</sup></a>.
       At the offertory is sung the first part of the beautiful
       hymn <i>Stabat Mater</i>: the music is Palestrina's, and is
       justly and highly panegyrised by Baini; it has been
       published by Dr. Burney. Both the <i>introit</i> and
       <span class="pagenum"><a name="page34"
       id="page34"></a>[pg 34]</span> communion are sung without,
       and the offertory with, counterpoint: the <i>Kyrie
       eleison</i>, Gradual and tract, in plain chant. The
       Benedictus qui venit is usually very beautiful. At the end
       of the mass, as there has been no sermon, the Card.
       celebrant announces from the altar the Pope's usual grant to
       all present of an indulgence<a id="footnotetag43"
       name="footnotetag43"></a><a href="#footnote43"><sup>43</sup></a>
       or remission of the <i>temporal</i> punishment due for past
       sins, whose guilt has been already remitted.</p>

    <p class="side">indulgences</p>

    <p>When the mass is ended, the palms are carried home by those
    who have received them, and are preserved with respect. Two
    larger than the rest are kept until the ascension, in the
    sacristy called the <i>Letto dei Paramenti</i> because
    anciently the aged Pontiffs after their fatiguing walk to the
    stational churches used to repose on a <i>letto</i> or bed
    prepared for them in the sacristy, where they afterwards put on
    the <i>paramenti</i> or vestments. The paschal candle also, an
    emblem of Christ the true light, as we shall afterwards see is
    removed on the day of the ascension: this circumstance may
    explain the above-mentioned
    custom.</p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page35"
       id="page35"></a>[pg 35]</span>

    <p class="side">Cardinal penitentiary at S. John Lateran's.</p>

    <p>In the afternoon of palm-sunday, the Cardinal great
    Penitentiary goes in state to S. John Lateran's. He is met,
    before he enters their college, by the minor penitentiaries,
    who at this basilic are Franciscans, <i>minori osservanti</i>.
    Having sprinkled those present with holy water, he goes up to
    their private oratory<a id="footnotetag44"
       name="footnotetag44"></a><a href="#footnote44"><sup>44</sup></a>
       in the Lateran palace, whither he is escorted by the
       prelates and other ministers of the apostolic
       <i>Penitenzieria</i>. After a short prayer, he proceeds to
       the library, where he holds the <i>Segnatura</i> or tribunal
       for signing documents relating to his office, and afterwards
       enters the basilic of St. John Lateran's, where he is
       received by four canons. Here seated at his tribunal of
       penance, he touches with his rod the heads of the prelates,
       ministers and others who approach to him; and for this act
       of humiliation they receive an indulgence, or remission of
       the canonical penance, of 100 days. He also hears the
       confessions of any persons who may choose to present
       themselves: but the solution of difficult cases and
       absolution from crimes reserved to his jurisdiction may be
       obtained without confessing to his Eminence on so public an
       occasion<a id="footnotetag45"
       name="footnotetag45"></a><a href="#footnote45"><sup>45</sup></a>.</p><span class="pagenum">
    <a name="page36"

    <p>The ceremonies, which we have described, are designed to
    honour our divine Redeemer, whose actions and sufferings are
    thereby commemorated, and at the same time to excite sentiments
    of devotion in the hearts of His servants. Here ought the
    catholic to exercise faith, hope, love, and contrition for his
    sins: and <i>all</i>, of whatever country or creed they may be,
    who are admitted with hospitality and liberality to witness the
    solemn and imposing service, if they do not feel such noble
    sentiments, ought at least to observe that external decorum,
    which the season, the place, the hierarchy, and above all the
    commemoration of the sufferings of the God of charity will
    dictate to every well-educated and well-principled mind. It is
    to be lamented, that not only the devotion of Catholics is
    disturbed, but their feelings also are occasionally insulted in
    their own house of worship by the unbecoming remarks of
    individuals&mdash;but enough: "you have not so learned Christ:
    if yet you have heard him, and have been taught in him, as the
    truth is in Jesus". Ephes. IV, 20, 21. If on this day even the
    inhabitants of Jerusalem received Him with triumph and jubilee,
    let us His disciples and children offer to Him the best tribute
    in our power of love praise and adoration.</p>

        <p>In times of schism caused by antipopes it was a practice
        of the utmost importance. Thus we read in Baronius' Annals
        A.D. 1160, that when the antipope Cardinal Octavianus, who
        assumed the name of Victor, had been illegitimately
        elected, the chapter of St. Peter's came immediately to the
        feet of the said Pope Victor, and <i>obeyed</i> "obedivit"
        and the clergy and people paid due reverence to him, and a
        great multitude in like manner <i>obeyed</i>: "the rectors
        also came to his feet, and paid <i>obedience</i> and
        reverence". Then follows a long list of the clergy of
        various Roman churches, all of whom it is said that they
        <i>obeyed</i>. Thus,</p>

        <p>"The Lateran prior and his canons <i>obeyed</i>. The
        clergy of the patriarchal church of S. Mary Major's
        <i>obeyed</i> etc."</p>

        <p>This <i>obedience</i> was evidently an external sign of
        their acknowledging Victor as Pope in place of Alexander,
        the legitimate pontiff. Anciently the Pope received the
        homage of the deacons in the sacristy; they afterwards went
        out of the sacristy to put on their dalmatics. Cancellieri
        de Secretariis T.I. In the sacristy the Pope gave the
        <i>peace</i> to the Bishops, Cardinals, Prefect, Senator,
        and other lay princes according to the canon Benedict,
        Cencius Camerarius and Cajetan. The ordines Romani mention
        the bowing of the Subdeacon at the knees of the Pontiff,
        and the kissing of his hand by the priests, the archdeacon
        and secundarius De secretariis T. I, p. 409.</p>

        <p>Many forms of benediction of persons and things taken
        from ancient Pontificals and manuscript rituals may be seen
        in Martene, De antiquis Ecclesiae Ritibus. The church
        generally uses holy-water and incense when blessing God's
        creatures, which are "sanctified by the word of God and
        prayer" 1 Tom. IV, 5. God had appointed water of expiation
        to be used by the Jews, Numbers XIX. Lustral water used to
        be sprinkled also by the Pagans; Terque senem flamma, ter
        aqua, ter sulphure purget. Ov. Met. l. 7. Anastasius says
        that Alexander I, who was Pope in 108 "appointed that water
        for sprinkling should be blessed with salt in private
        houses." It is mentioned also in the apostolic
        constitutions. Boldetti in his <i>Cemeterii de' martiri</i>
        notices the short columns supporting small vases, in
        corners of the chapels in the catacombs; and Bottari has
        published and illustrated in his <i>Roma sotterranea</i> an
        interesting fresco discovered in the catacombs of S.
        Agnese, and representing five figures carrying vessels
        closely resembling those still used for holy water; four of
        those figures carry branches supposed to be of the
        palm-tree: the fifth holds an aspergillum with which holy
        water is still sprinkled. A copy of this fresco may be seen
        also in Rock's Hierurgia, p. 668. Incense is a symbol of
        prayers. "Let my prayer, O Lord" we say with the Psalmist
        "be directed as incense in thy sight". God had appointed it
        to be used in the Jewish worship, and St. John says, that
        an "angel came and stood before the altar, having a golden
        censer, and there was given to him much incense, that he
        should offer of the prayers of all the saints upon the
        golden altar, which is before the throne of God: and the
        smoke of the incense of the prayers of the saints ascended
        up before God, from the hand of the angel". Apoc. VIII, 3,
        5. Of the apostolic antiquity of its use the Protestant
        bishop Beveridge adduces proofs in his Vindication of the
        apostolical canons. The ancient liturgies of the east and
        west agree in prescribing the use of incense, and in
        particular at the beginning of mass, at the offertory etc.
        See Renaudot, Assemani, Le Brun etc. Constantine, according
        to Anastasius in his life of S. Silvester, gave two golden
        thuribles to the Lateran basilis, and a third adorned with
        jewels to the Baptistery. See Card. Bona, Rerum
        Liturgicarum lib. I, c. XXV, § 9.</p>

        <p>Of the antiquity of the custom of kissing the Pope's
        foot we have proofs in Anastasius the librarian in the
        lives of Popes Constantine and Leo IV. When Valentine was
        elected Pope in 827, his feet were kissed by the Roman
        senate and people at S. John Lateran's. Numerous instances
        also are on record of sovereigns who have kissed the feet
        of the Popes, and Pouyard has written a dissertation to
        shew, that this custom was anterior to that of marking the
        papal shoes or sandals with a cross. This token of profound
        respect was given also to the emperors of the east at
        Byzantium.</p>

        <p>The kings and chief magistrates of ancient Rome were
        entitled to a <i>sella curulis</i>, or chair of state,
        which used to be placed in their chariots. Gell. III; 18.
        They were seated on it also at their tribunal on solemn
        occasions. Virgil makes old king Latinus say:</p>

        <p>Et <i>sellam regni</i> trabeamque <i>insignia
        nostri</i>. Æn. XI. 334. The Romans had borrowed it from
        the Etruscans according to Dionysius of Halicarnassus.
        (Clement of Alexandria observes, That many of the rites of
        Etruria were imported from Asia; and Diodorus (lib. 5.)
        represents these insignia as derived from Lydia. See
        Phoebens. De Identitate Cathedræ S. Petri p. XX. seq.) It
        was richly adorned, <i>conspicuum signis</i>, according to
        Ovid, Pont. IV. 5, 18. In the Pope's carriage even now
        there is a chair of state, and to Him alone is reserved the
        honour of a <i>sedia gestatoria</i>. Pope Stephen II in 751
        was carried to the basilica of Constantine on the shoulders
        of the Romans exulting at his election: and from this fact
        some derive the custom of carrying the Pope in His chair on
        solemn occasions.</p>

        <p>That God, after He has pardoned sin and consequently
        remitted its eternal punishment, often, if not generally,
        demands temporal satisfaction from the sinner, is evident
        from many instances in scripture, such as those of David (2
        Sam. XII) of Moses (Deuteron. XXXII compare Num. XIV) to
        say nothing of Adam (Gen. III) and all his posterity, who
        endure the temporal punishment of original sin, even when
        its stain has been washed away by baptism. Now the church
        by virtue of the ample authority with which Christ has
        invested her (Matt. XVIII, John XX) and in particular her
        chief pastor (Matt. XVI) has from the beginning exercised
        the power of remitting the temporal punishment of actual
        sins. Thus S. Paul pardoned the incestuous Corinthian (2.
        Cor. II): in times of persecution the bishops at the
        request of the martyrs remitted the penance imposed on
        those who had fallen into idolatry (Tersul. lib. ad
        martyres, Euseb. Hist. Eccl. lib. V, c. 4. S. Cyprian.
        Epist. XIII etc.), to say nothing of canons of the 4th
        century which prescribe that indulgences should be granted
        to <i>fervent</i> penitents, of the crusades, and of the
        indulgences granted to those who contributed money for the
        building of S. Peter's, etc. Indulgences presuppose
        repentance and confession, and the performance of those
        good works which are prescribed as conditions necessary for
        their acquisition, as communion, prayers, alms etc.</p>

        <p>In the third century, in the time of Pope Cornelius
        there were priests appointed to absolve those who had
        fallen into idolatry; and they were called <i>Presbyteri
        Pænitentium</i>. S. Marcellus also, according to
        Anastasius, after the persecution raised by Diocletian,
        appointed in Rome titular churches, in which penance as
        well as baptism were administered by priests, the former
        sacrament is conferred by the minor penitentiaries. Pope
        Simplicius in fine, as we learn from the same author,
        destined fixed weeks at S. Peter's, S. Paul's, and S.
        Laurence's, to <i>receive penitents</i> and administer
        baptism. From the usual custom of Rome in such matters,
        Zaccaria argues that during the first five or six
        centuries, according to the general custom proved by
        Thomassin, the great penitentiary was the <i>bishop himself
        of the city</i> in which they resided. It is however
        certain, that in the 4th century from the numerous priests
        of Constantinople one was selected called a penitentiary,
        who took cognisance of crimes, to which public penance was
        annexed by the canons. At Rome also there was a cardinal
        penitentiary long before the fourth council of Lateran,
        which in 1215 prescribed that bishops should appoint
        penitentiaries, for Berthod priest of Constance relates in
        his chronicle, that in the year 1084 he was promoted to the
        dignity of cardinal-priest and penitentiary of the Roman
        church.</p>

    <p class="side">P. I. Breviary.</p>

    <p>We shall not hesitate to borrow the following account of the
    church office contained in the Roman Breviary from a Protestant
    divine (Tracts of the Times no. 75). "The word <i>Breviarum</i>
    first occurs in the work of an author of the eleventh century
    (Micrologus) and it is used to denote a compendium or
    systematic arrangement of the devotional offices of the church.
    Till that time they were contained in several independent
    volumes, according to the nature of each. Such, for instance,
    were the <i>Psalteria</i>, <i>Homilaria</i>, <i>Hymnaria</i>,
    and the like, to be used in the service in due course. But at
    his memorable era, and under the auspices of the Pontiff who
    makes it memorable, Gregory VII, an Order was drawn up, for the
    use of the Roman <span class="pagenum"><a name="page38"
       id="page38"></a>[pg 38]</span> church, containing in one all
       these different collections, introducing the separate
       members of each in its proper place, and harmonising them
       together by the use of rubrics.</p>

    <p class="side">Divine office, its origin.</p>

    <p>"Gregory VII did but restore and harmonise these offices;
    which seem to have existed more or less the same in constituent
    parts, though not in order and system, from Apostolic times. In
    their present shape they are appointed for seven distinct
    seasons in the twenty four hours, and consist of prayers,
    praises and thanksgivings of various forms; and, as regards
    both contents and hours, are the continuation of a system of
    worship observed by the Apostles and their converts. As to
    <i>contents</i>, the Breviary service consists of the Psalms;
    of Hymns and Canticles; of Lessons and Texts from inspired and
    Ecclesiastical authors; of Antiphons, Verses and Responses, and
    Sentences; and of Collects. And analogous to this seems to have
    been the usage of the Corinthian Christians, whom St. Paul
    blames for refusing to agree in some common order of worship,
    when they came together, <i>every one of them</i> having a
    Psalm, or a doctrine, a tongue, a revelation, an interpretation
    (1 Cor. XIV, 26). On the other hand, the catholic
    <i>seasons</i> of devotion are certainly derived from apostolic
    usage. The Jewish observance of the third, sixth and ninth
    hours for prayer, was continued by the inspired founders of the
    Christian church. What Daniel had practised, even when the
    decree was signed forbidding it, "<i>kneeling on his knees
    three times a day, and praying and giving thanks unto his
    God</i>", S. Peter and the other Apostles were solicitous in
    preserving. It was when "<i>they were all with one accord in
    one place</i>", at "the <i>third</i> hour of the day", that the
    Holy Ghost came down upon them at Pentecost. It was at the
    <i>sixth</i> hour, that St. Peter "went up upon the house-top
    to pray" and saw the vision revealing to him the admission of
    the gentiles into <span class="pagenum"><a name="page39"
       id="page39"></a>[pg 39]</span> church. And it was at the
       <i>ninth</i> hour that "Peter and John went up together into
       the temple", being "the hour of prayer". But though these
       were the more remarkable seasons of devotion, there
       certainly were others besides them in the first age of the
       church. After our Saviour's departure, the Apostles, we are
       informed, "all <i>continued</i> with one accord in prayer
       and supplication, with the women, and Mary the mother of
       Jesus, and with His brethren": and with this accords the
       repealed exhortation to pray together without ceasing, which
       occurs in St. Paul's epistles. It will be observed that he
       insists in one passage on prayer to the abridgment of sleep
       (Eph. VI, 18); and one recorded passage of his life
       exemplifies his precept: "And at midnight Paul and Silas
       prayed, and sang praises unto God, and the prisoners heard
       them".</p>

    <p>In subsequent times the Hours of prayer were gradually
    developed from the three, or (with midnight) the four seasons
    above enumerated, to seven, viz. by the addition of Prime (the
    first hour), Vespers (the evening), and Compline (bedtime);
    according to the words of the Psalm, "Seven times a day do I
    praise Thee, because of Thy righteous judgment. Other pious and
    instructive reasons existed, or have since been perceived for
    this number".<a id="footnotetag46"

       Thus far our Protestant author, with whose remarks we are
       too well pleased to go out of our way to dispute with him
       the truth of some other portions of his tract, which are
       objectionable.</p>

    <p class="side">Performed by the early Christians.</p>

    <p>That the early Christians continued after the time of the
    apostles to observe the hours of prayer above enumerated is
    proved by Martene (De Ant. Eccl. Rit. T. 3) who
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page40"
       id="page40"></a>[pg 40]</span> has collected many decisive
       passages from the Greek and Latin Fathers. We shall content
       ourselves with one taken from a work on prayer by S.
       Cyprian, bishop of Carthage in the third century. Having
       mentioned Daniel's practice of praying three times a day, he
       observes, that it is manifest that there was something
       mysterious or symbolical in the ancient practice. "For the
       holy Ghost descended on the disciples at the third hour; at
       the sixth hour Peter going to the house-top was instructed
       by God to admit all to the grace of salvation; and the Lord,
       who was crucified at the sixth hour, washed away our sins
       with his blood at the ninth hour, and completed the victory
       by his passion. For us however, besides the hours anciently
       observed, the times and also the symbols of prayer have
       increased. For we must pray in the morning, to celebrate the
       resurrection of the Lord; also when the sun recedes and the
       day ceases; for Christ is the true sun and the true day, and
       when we pray that the light of Christ may again come upon
       us, we pray that his coming may impart to us the grace of
       eternal light: and let us who are always in Christ, that is,
       in the light, not cease from prayer at night". See also Dr.
       Cave's Primitive Christianity Part. 1, c. 9.</p>

    <p class="side">Editions of the breviary.</p>

    <p>"The old Roman breviary" says the author of Tract 75 above
    quoted "had long before Gregory VII's time been received in
    various parts of Europe; and in England since the time of
    Gregory the great who after the pattern of Leo and Gelasius
    before him had been a reformer of it". The people used
    anciently to join with the clergy in offering this, constant
    tribute of praise to God; but the duty of daily reciting it is
    obligatory only upon the Catholic clergy, and religious orders.
    S. Benedict shortened it considerably, (as Grancolas observes,
    Com. Hist. in Brev. Rom.) New editions and emendations of it
    were published successively by the authority of St. Gregory
    VII, Nicholas III, and Clement VII, and finally the Roman
    Breviary at present <span class="pagenum"><a name="page41"
       id="page41"></a>[pg 41]</span> used was restored by order of
       the Council of Trent, published by Pope Pius V, and revised
       by Clement VIII, and Urban VIII. It follows closely, as
       Merati observes, that first adopted by the regular-clerks in
       the 16th century, and resembles the edition published by
       Haymo, general of the Franciscans, and authorised by
       Nicholas III (A.D. 1278). Hence it is called by the author
       of Tract 75 the <i>Franciscan</i> Breviary. It is however
       founded upon the old Roman Breviary, which the Franciscans
       by the direction of their holy founder had adopted: for
       according to Rodolfo, dean of Tongres Cap. XXII, when the
       Popes dwelt at the Lateran, the <i>office of the Papal
       chapel</i> was much shorter than that of the other churches
       of Rome; it was composed by Innocent III, and was adopted by
       the Franciscans instituted at his time. Nicolas III ordered
       that all the Roman churches should use the Franciscan
       Breviary as reformed by Haymo, in 1241. "Our own daily
       service", says the above-mentioned minister of the church of
       England is confessedly formed upon the Breviary".</p>

    <p class="side">P. II. Office of Tenebræ.</p>

    <p>Having premised thus much on the office in general, we may
    now return to holy-week. Besides palm-sunday, three other days
    in the week are particularly devoted to the commemoration of
    the history of our redemption; holy-thursday, because on it our
    Lord instituted the blessed Eucharist, and his passion began;
    good-friday, on which He was crucified and died; and holy
    saturday, on which His sacred body remained in the tomb. The
    church commences her solemn service of each of these days with
    that part of the divine office called matins and lauds, and at
    this time Tenebrae from the <i>darkness</i> with which it
    concludes. It used of old to be celebrated at night, as it
    still is by some religious communities<a id="footnotetag47"
       name="footnotetag47"></a><a href="#footnote47"><sup>47</sup></a>;
       but it <span class="pagenum"><a name="page42"
       id="page42"></a>[pg 42]</span> now takes place on the
       afternoon preceding each of those three days. Nor is this
       unusual: for "the ecclesiastical day is considered to begin
       with the evening or Vesper service, according to the Jewish
       reckoning, as alluded to in the text. "In the evening and
       morning and at noon day will I pray, and that instantly".
       (Tracts of the Times, No. 75).</p>

    <p class="side">Matins and Lauds.</p>

    <p>The office of Matin so called from Matuta or Aurora consists
    at Tenebræ of three <i>nocturns</i>. Each of these is composed
    of three appropriate psalms with their anthems, followed by
    three lessons taken from scripture or the fathers. Immediately
    after matins, Lauds or the praises of God are sung: they
    consist of five psalms besides the <i>Benedictus</i> or
    canticle of Zachary, to which succeeds the <i>Miserere</i> or
    50th psalm. Some of the short prayers usually said are omitted:
    for the church during this season of mourning strips her
    liturgy as well as her altars of their usual
    ornaments<a id="footnotetag48"
       name="footnotetag48"></a><a href="#footnote48"><sup>48</sup></a>.</p>

    <p class="side">Extinction of the lights.</p>

    <p>A triangular candlestick, upon which are placed fifteen
    candles, corresponding to the number of psalms recited before
    the <i>Miserere</i>, is peculiar to this solemn office, and is
    placed at the epistle-side of the altar. After each psalm one
    of the candles is extinguished by a Master of ceremonies, and
    after the <i>Benedictus</i> the candle placed on the top
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page43"
       id="page43"></a>[pg 43]</span> of the triangular candlestick
       is not extinguished, but is concealed behind the altar and
       brought out at the end of the service; while that canticle
       is sung, the six candles on the altar also are extinguished,
       as well as those above the <i>cancellata</i> or
       rails<a id="footnotetag49"
       name="footnotetag49"></a><a href="#footnote49"><sup>49</sup></a>.</p>

    <p class="side">Meaning of this ceremony.</p>

    <p>Lamps and candelabra were presented to the sanctuary by the
    faithful during the first ages of persecution; and in more
    tranquil times to the basilicas by Constantine and others who
    erected or dedicated them. They were lighted, as S. Jerome
    observes, in the day time "not to drive away darkness, but as a
    sign of joy": and therefore the custom of gradually
    extinguishing them at the office of Tenebrae we may justly
    consider with Amalarius as a sign of mourning, or of the
    sympathy of the church with her divine and suffering Spouse.
    The precise number of lights is determined by that of the
    psalms, which is the same as at ordinary matins of three
    nocturns.</p>

    <p>The custom of concealing behind the altar during the last
    part of the office the last and most elevated candle, and of
    bringing it forward burning at the end of the service, is a
    manifest allusion to the death and resurrection of Christ,
    whose light, as Micrologus observes, is represented by our
    burning tapers. "I am the light of the
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page44"
       id="page44"></a>[pg 44]</span> world". John VIII.
       12<a id="footnotetag50"
       name="footnotetag50"></a><a href="#footnote50"><sup>50</sup></a>.
       In the same manner the other candles extinguished one after
       another may represent the prophets successively put to death
       before their divine Lord: and if we consider that the psalms
       of the <i>old Testament</i> are recited at the time, this
       explanation may appear more satisfactory than others, which
       would refer them to the blessed Virgin, the apostles and
       disciples of Christ<a id="footnotetag51"
       name="footnotetag51"></a><a href="#footnote51"><sup>51</sup></a>.
       In the triangular form of the candlestick is contained an
       evident allusion to the B. Trinity. This candlestick is
       mentioned in a MS. Ordo of the 7th century published by
       Mabillon.</p>

    <p class="side">Chant, lamentations.</p>

    <p>The anthems and psalms, with the exception of the
    <i>Miserere</i> which is the last psalm at Lauds, most of the
    lessons and other parts of the office, are sung in plain chant.
    From the middle of the 15th century the three lamentations or
    first three lessons of each day used to be sung in <i>canto
    figurato</i> in the papal chapel: but by order of Sixtus V,
    only the first lamentation of each day is thus sung, and even
    it is much shortened, as Clement XII directed: the two others
    are sung in <i>canto piano</i> according to Guidetti's method.
    The first lamentation both of the first and second day is by
    the celebrated Pierluigi da Palestrina: that of the third day
    by Allegri. Baini observes, that the first lamentation of the
    second day is considered the finest: Palestrina composed it for
    four voices, besides a bass, which entering at the pathetic
    apostrophe 'Jerusalem, Jerusalem, be converted to the Lord'
    "every year makes <span class="pagenum"><a name="page45"
       id="page45"></a>[pg 45]</span> all the hearers and singers,
       who have a soul, change colour". Bayni, Mem. Stor. T. 1. The
       lamentations of Jeremiah have the form of an acrostic, that
       is, the verses begin with the letters of the Hebrew alphabet
       in regular order, the first with Aleph, the second with
       Beth, and so in succession. It was difficult to observe a
       similar order in the Latin Vulgate: but to preserve some
       vestige of it, the name of the Hebrew letter, with which
       each verse begins in the original, is sung before the same
       verse in the translation.</p>

    <p class="side">Conclusion of the office.</p>

    <p>When the <i>Benedictus</i> or canticle of Zachary and its
    anthem are finished, the choir sings the verse "Christ was made
    for us obedient even unto death": on the second night they add
    "even unto the death of the cross": and on the third, "for
    which reason God hath exalted him, and hath given him a name,
    which is above all names". The heart of the christian is melted
    to devotion by these words, sung on so solemn an occasion: he
    kneels before his crucified Redeemer, and recites that prayer
    of love, that prayer of a child to his Father which He that man
    of sorrows dictated to His beloved disciples; and then
    remembering those sins, by which he offended that dear and
    agonising parent, and touched with sorrow and repentance, yet
    more and more excited by the music, I might almost call it
    celestial, his heart calls loudly for that mercy to obtain
    which Jesus died. He joins with God's minister in fervently
    repeating the prayer imploring God's blessing on those for whom
    Christ suffered and died: the noise which follows it recals to
    his mind the confusion of nature at the death of her creator;
    the lighted candle once more appearing reminds him that His
    death was only temporary: and he departs in silence impressed
    with pious sentiments, and inflamed with devout affections.</p>

    <p class="side">Miserere, its music.</p>

    <p>They who have assisted at the office of Tenebræ will not be
    surprised at the saying of a philosopher, that for the
    advantage of his soul he would wish, that when he
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page46"
       id="page46"></a>[pg 46]</span> was about to render it up to
       God, he might hear sung the <i>Miserere</i> of the Pope's
       chapel. In no other place has this celebrated music
       succeeded. Baini the director of the Pontifical choir, in a
       note to his life of Palestrina, observes that Paride de
       Grassi, Master of ceremonies to Leo X, mentions that on holy
       wednesday (A.D. 1519), the singers chanted the
       <i>Miserere</i> in a <i>new</i> and <i>unaccustomed</i>
       manner, alternately singing the verses in symphony. This
       seems to be the origin of the far-famed <i>Miserere</i>.
       Various authors, whom Baini enumerates, afterwards composed
       <i>Miserere</i><a id="footnotetag52"
       name="footnotetag52"></a><a href="#footnote52"><sup>52</sup></a>;
       but the celebrated composition of Gregorio Allegri a Roman,
       who entered the Papal college of singers in 1629, was the
       most successful, and was for some time sung on all the three
       days of Tenebræ. Then one composed by Alessandro Scarlatti,
       or that of Felice Anerio, used to be sung on holy thursday:
       but these were eclipsed by the <i>Miserere</i>, composed in
       1214 by Tommase Bai a Bolognese, director of the choir of S.
       Peter's. From that time only Allegri's and Bai's were sung
       in the Pope's chapel; till Pius VII directed the celebrated
       Baini to compose a new <i>Miserere</i>, which has received
       well-merited applause. Since the year 1821 all three, viz.
       Baini's, Bai's, and Allegri's <i>Misereres</i> are sung on
       the three successive days, and generally in the order in
       which we have mentioned them: the two latter are sometimes
       blended together. The first verse is sung in harmony, the
       second in plain chant, and so successively till the last
       verse, which alone is sung in harmony by both the choirs,
       into which the singers are divided; only one choir sings the
       other verses<a id="footnotetag53"
       name="footnotetag53"></a><a href="#footnote53"><sup>53</sup></a>.</p><span class="pagenum">

    <p class="side">Cardinal penitentiary</p>

    <p class="side">Trinità dei Pellegrini</p>

    <p>On Wednesday-afternoon, the Cardinal great Penitentiary goes
    in state to S. Mary Major's, where the minor Penitentiaries are
    Dominicans. For an account of this custom see the preceding
    chapter. On Wednesday, Thursday and Friday evenings, Christians
    may be edified at the Trinità dei
    Pellegrini<a id="footnotetag54"
       name="footnotetag54"></a><a href="#footnote54"><sup>54</sup></a>
       by the sight of Cardinals, princes, prelates and others,
       washing in good earnest, and afterwards kissing the feet of
       poor pilgrims, while they recite with them the Our Father,
       Hail Mary, Glory be to the Father, and other beautiful
       prayers, such as;</p>

    <div class="poem">
        <div class="stanza">
            <p><i>Gesù, Giuseppe, Maria,</i></p>

            <p><i>Vi dono il cuore e l' anima mia.</i></p>

            <p><i>Gesù, Giuseppe, Maria,</i></p>

            <p><i>Assisteleci nell' ultima agonia, etc.</i></p>
        </div>
    </div>

    <p>They afterwards wait on them at table, and accompany them to
    their beds, reciting other devout prayers. In another part of
    that establishment, princesses and other ladies practise the
    same offices of charity towards the female pilgrims. Here might
    we fancy that the primitive christians were before us, those
    men of charity, simplicity, and lowliness: and when in the same
    place, a few years ago, that devout Pontiff Leo XII on his
    knees washed and kissed the feet of pilgrims, who had journeyed
    from afar; who that saw him did not call to mind with tears the
    lowliness and charity of his predecessor Peter, and of a
    greater than Peter, who "washed the feet of his disciples, and
    who wiped them with the towel wherewith he was girded".</p>

    <p>Marius mourned over the ruins of Carthage; but his was the
    sorrow of disappointed, selfish ambition. Jeremiah lamented the
    fall and desolation of Jerusalem: and his plaintive accents
    were inspired by genuine patriotism and
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page48"
       id="page48"></a>[pg 48]</span> religion. Observe his
       venerable figure in the Sixtine chapel; there he sits
       pensive and disconsolate, with his legs crossed, his wearied
       head resting upon his hand, and his eyes rivetted on the
       ground, as if nothing could engage his attention but the
       woes of the daughter of Sion<a id="footnotetag55"
       name="footnotetag55"></a><a href="#footnote55"><sup>55</sup></a>.
       Then listen to the lamentations of this inspired and
       afflicted prophet: they are full of deepest pathos, and
       uttered in notes sweet as the warblings of philomel. Turn
       now, O Christian soul, to a more sublime and mournful
       spectacle. Jesus in the garden of Gethsemani and on mount
       Calvary mourned not for a single city or nation: he sorrowed
       over the ruins of a world, not as of old Noah may have done,
       when secure from danger he looked down upon the waters which
       overspread the earth; but "He was wounded for our
       iniquities, and he was bruised for our sins: and the Lord
       hath laid on him the iniquities of us all", He suffered and
       died for us. The moral ruins of the world, our sins and
       their awful consequences, caused all the pangs and sorrows
       of Jesus. Come then let us cast ourselves at the foot of
       that cross, and cry aloud for mercy with a contrite and
       humble heart, which He will never despise. To <i>Thee</i>
       alone, shall we say, have we sinned, and have done evil
       before thee; yet have mercy on us, O God, according to thy
       great mercy. And thou, O blessed Virgin and Mother, who
       standest in silent anguish beneath the
       <span class="pagenum"><a name="page49"
       id="page49"></a>[pg 49]</span> cross of thy agonising
       Son<a id="footnotetag56"
       name="footnotetag56"></a><a href="#footnote56"><sup>56</sup></a>,
       would that we could feel love and sorrow like unto

        <p>Our divine Lord sometimes passed the night in prayer;
        and the early Christians, as Pliny informs his master
        Trajan, used to assemble before the light to sing a hymn to
        Christ. Lucian as well as Ammianus Marcellinus complained
        of their spending the night in singing hymns. S. Jerome in
        fine writes to Eustoch. (Ep. 22) that besides the daily
        hours of prayers we should rise <i>twice and thrice at

        <p>In the mass and office for the dead several prayers and

        and condoling with Christ our Redeemer in His sufferings".

        diurnal offices of holy-thursday is found, such as we now
        observe it, in the ancient Antiphonarium of the Roman
        church, and in that of S. Gregory published by B. Tommasi,
        so that there has been scarcely any variation during the
        last thirteen hundred years.</p>

        <p>When the Pope officiates, the eight candles over the
        <i>cancellata</i> are lighted: six are lighted for a
        Cardinal, and four for a Bishop. Amalarius priest of Metz
        in the ninth century (De ordine antiphonarii), mentions the
        extinction of the lights in the office of these three days.
        It would seem however, that it was not then customary at
        Rome, for Theodore, archdeacon of the Roman church, in
        answer to his enquiries had said to him "I am usually with
        the Apostolic Lord at the Lateran, when the office of Coena
        Domini (Holy Thursday) is celebrated, and it is not
        customary to extinguish the lights. On Good Friday there is
        no light of lamps or tapers in the church in Jerusalem
        (Santa Croce) as long as the Apostolic Lord offers up
        solemn prayers there, or when the cross is saluted". This
        latter custom is still continued.</p>

    </blockquote>

    <p class="side">Liturgy of holy-thursday.</p>

    <p>During the last three days of holy-week the church
    celebrates the funeral obsequies of her Divine Spouse: and
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page51"
       id="page51"></a>[pg 51]</span> hence there are numerous
       signs of mourning in her temples, in her liturgy, and in the
       dress of her ministers. On thursday however, a passing gleam
       of heavenly light irradiates the solemn gloom in which she
       is enveloped: for on this day Jesus Christ, having loved his
       own even unto the end, instituted the holy sacrament, the
       staff of our pilgrimage, our solace in affliction, our
       strength in temptation, the source of all virtue, and the
       pledge of everlasting life. Accordingly the liturgy of
       holy-thursday bears the impress both of sorrow and of
       gladness: it is not unlike a fitful day of April in our
       northern climes, when the sun now bursts from the clouds
       which had concealed his brilliancy, and now once more the
       sky is shrouded in murky gloom&mdash;an apt emblem this of
       the over-changing state of man, who at one moment quaffs the
       inebriating cup of earthly joys, and yet a little, and it is
       dashed from his grasp; and sickness, sorrow and death are
       his portion.</p>

    <p class="side">its ancient form.</p>

    <p>Anciently three masses used to be celebrated at
    Rome<a id="footnotetag57"
       name="footnotetag57"></a><a href="#footnote57"><sup>57</sup></a>
       on this day, as is evident from the sacramentary of pope
       Gelasius; and at all the three the Pope himself officiated.
       At the first the public penitents were
       absolved:<a id="footnotetag58"
       name="footnotetag58"></a><a href="#footnote58"><sup>58</sup></a>
       at the second the oils were blessed; the last (ad
       vespertinum officium) was intended to commemorate the
       institution of the blessed Sacrament. Public penance
       gradually declined in the western church after the seventh
       century; and the three masses are now reduced to one. That
       of the Sixtine chapel, at which the Pope assists, differs
       very little from ordinary Masses celebrated there, and the
       concourse of persons is generally very great.</p>

    <p class="side">Blessing of the oils at S. Peter's</p>

    <p class="side">Communion under one kind.</p>

    <p>The oils are blessed in S. Peter's during mass, by the Card.
    archpriest, or a Bishop in his stead. They are three,
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page52"
       id="page52"></a>[pg 52]</span> viz. 1 the oil of
       catechumens, used in blessing baptism, in consecrating
       churches and altars, in ordaining priests, and in blessing
       and crowning sovereigns: 2 the oil of the sick used in
       administering extreme unction and in blessing bells: 3
       sacred chrism, composed of oil, and balm of Gilead or of the
       west Indies<a id="footnotetag59"
       name="footnotetag59"></a><a href="#footnote59"><sup>59</sup></a>:
       it is used in conferring baptism and confirmation, in the
       consecration of bishops, of patens and chalices, and in the
       blessing of bells. The Roman Pontifical prescribes, that
       besides the bishop and the usual ministers, there should be
       present twelve priests, seven deacons, and seven subdeacons,
       all habited in white vestments. After the elevation at those
       words of the canon, <i>Per quem hæc omnia etc.</i> a little
       before the <i>Pater noster</i>, the Bishop sits down before
       a table facing the altar, and exorcises and blesses the oil
       for the sick, which is brought in by a subdeacon. He then
       proceeds with the mass, and gives communion to the ministers
       and the rest of the under the form of bread
       alone<a id="footnotetag60"
       name="footnotetag60"></a><a href="#footnote60"><sup>60</sup></a>.
       Having received <span class="pagenum"><a name="page53"
       id="page53"></a>[pg 53]</span> the ablutions, he returns to
       the table above mentioned, and awaits the coming of the
       procession of the priests, deacons, subdeacons etc. In it,
       the balsam is carried by a subdeacon, etc. the oil for the
       chrism and that for the catechumens by two deacons: and
       meantime the choir sings appropriate verses. The bishop
       blesses the balsam, and mixes it with
       <span class="pagenum"><a name="page54"
       id="page54"></a>[pg 54]</span> some oil; he then breathes
       three times in the form of a cross over the vessel of
       chrism, as do the twelve priests also. Next follows the
       blessing, and then the salutation, of the chrism: the latter
       is made 3 times by the bishop and each of the twelve priests
       in succession, saying, Hail holy chrism, after which they
       kiss the vessel which contains it. The oil of catechumens is
       blessed and saluted in like manner: and the procession
       returns to the sacristy; in the mean time the bishop
       concludes the mass; and thus this solemn rite
       terminates.</p>

    <p class="side">Origin of the blessing of the oils.</p>

    <p>The oil of the sick is mentioned in the well-known passage
    of St. James V, 14 "Is any man sick among you; let him bring in
    the priests of the church, and let them pray over him,
    anointing him with oil in the name of the Lord etc." At the
    beginning of the fifth century also, Pope Innocent I observes
    that it is the office of the bishop to make or prepare
    (<i>conficere</i>) this "holy of chrism" or unction: and in the
    Sacramentary of Pope Gregory the great the rite; by which this
    oil was blessed and administered to the sick, is described.
    Chrism and the oil of catechumens also are mentioned by many
    ancient Fathers. (See Turnely T. 7 de Sacram. Bapt. et Confirm,
    etc.)<a id="footnotetag61"
       name="footnotetag61"></a><a href="#footnote61"><sup>61</sup></a>
       St. Basil in the 4th century attributes the origin of the
       custom of blessing the oils to tradition. "We bless the
       water of baptism and the <i>oil of unction</i>, as well as
       the person who receives baptism. By what scriptures? Is it
       not from silent and secret tradition?" (De Spir. S. c. 27).
       It is mentioned also in the second and third councils of
       Carthage, by S. Cyprian, who says "The eucharist, and the
       oil, with which the baptised are anointed, are sanctified at
       the altar". Ep.
       70.</p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page55"
       id="page55"></a>[pg 55]</span>

    <p>It would appear however from the 20th canon of the first
    council of Toledo that anciently chrism could be blessed <i>at
    any time</i>; and hence Benedict XIV is of opinion, that the
    custom of blessing it only on holy Thursday began about the
    seventh century; for it is mentioned in the Sacramentary of S.
    Gregory, in the old Ordo Romanus, and in other works written
    after that period. This day has been with reason chosen for
    this ceremony, as St. Thomas observes, in order that the chrism
    may be prepared for the solemn baptism administered on Easter
    Eve; and because on it the Eucharistic sacrament, for which the
    other sacraments are as it were preparatory, was instituted. S.
    Isidore however assigns a different reason, viz. that two days
    before the pasch Mary <i>anointed</i> the head and feet of the
    Lord". De Divi Off. lib. 2, c. 28.</p>

    <p class="side">Meaning of the ceremonies already
    described.</p>

    <p>Pouget (Institut. Cath. t. 2, c. 8) proves that the blessing
    of the oils originates in apostolic tradition, as St. Basil
    cited above observes. He proves also that since the fifth and
    sixth centuries the bishop and priests used to breathe three
    times over the chrism and oil of catechumens, and to salute
    them with the words "Ave sanctum chrisma: ave sanctum oleum".
    Our Saviour breathed on His apostles, when He said 'Receive ye
    the holy Ghost': and hence his ministers breathe over the
    chrism, by which the Holy Ghost is conferred in confirmation,
    and over the oil of catechumens, which is used in other sacred
    rites. Respect is paid to them, because they are employed in
    God's service, and hence it is a relative respect directed to
    Him. An ardent soul will never hesitate to address inanimate
    objects; in fact some of the finest passages of ancient and
    modern oratory are apostrophes of this
    nature<a id="footnotetag62"
       name="footnotetag62"></a><a href="#footnote62"><sup>62</sup></a>.
       S. Andrew is said to have saluted the cross, on
       <span class="pagenum"><a name="page56"
       id="page56"></a>[pg 56]</span> which he suffered, S. Paula
       the birth-place of our divine Lord; and theirs were words of
       love of God, and not of idolatry.</p>

    <p class="side">High mass in the Sixtine chapel.</p>

    <p>In the Sixtine chapel the crucifix and tapestry over the
    altar are covered with a white and not a purple veil; the
    throne also is white, and the Pope is vested in a white cope.
    On the rich facing of the altar is represented Christ dead, His
    descent into limbo, and His resurrection. The cardinal dean
    generally celebrates the high mass, after the <i>Gloria in
    excelsis</i> of which no bells are allowed to be tolled in Rome
    (except at the papal benediction) but in their stead are used
    <i>troccole</i> or boards struck with iron: this practice is
    observed until the <i>Gloria in excelsis</i> is sung in the
    papal chapel on the following
    saturday-morning<a id="footnotetag63"
       name="footnotetag63"></a><a href="#footnote63"><sup>63</sup></a>.</p>

    <p>After the offertory of the mass Palestrina's motet
    <i>Fratres ego enim</i> is sung; of which Baini says that he
    "does not hesitate to affirm that it resembles as closely as
    possible the music of heaven". Two hosts are consecrated, one
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page57"
       id="page57"></a>[pg 57]</span> of which is received by the
       celebrant, and the other destined for the following day is
       put into a chalice, which the deacon covers with a paten and
       <i>palla</i> or linen cloth, as the dead body of Christ was
       wrapped in "fine linen"<a id="footnotetag64"
       name="footnotetag64"></a><a href="#footnote64"><sup>64</sup></a>.
       Mark XV, 46. At the beginning of the canon twelve lighted
       torches are brought in by <i>bussolanti</i>; and after the
       elevation two masters of ceremonies distribute among the
       cardinals and others candles carried by clerks of the
       chapel, in preparation for the procession. The usual kiss of
       peace is not given, from detestation of the treacherous kiss
       given this day by Judas to his divine master, as Alcuin
       remarks<a id="footnotetag65"
       name="footnotetag65"></a><a href="#footnote65"><sup>65</sup></a>.</p>

    <p class="side">Antiquity of processions</p>

    <p>Immediately after mass the cardinal celebrant with his
    ministers leaves the chapel; the other cardinals, bishops and
    mitred abbots, put on their respective sacred vestments, and
    the <i>Uditori di Rota</i>, the <i>Cherici di Camera,
    Votanti</i>, and <i>Abbreviatiori</i>, their surplices: the
    other prelates wear their usual <i>cappe</i>. They all now
    accompany the B. Sacrament to the Pauline
    chapel<a id="footnotetag66"
       name="footnotetag66"></a><a href="#footnote66"><sup>66</sup></a>
       in solemn procession, which
       <span class="pagenum"><a name="page58"
       id="page58"></a>[pg 58]</span> is regulated like that of
       palm-Sunday. The singers go to the <i>sala regia</i>,
       illuminated with large cornucopia, and there begin to sing
       the <i>Pange lingua</i> (a hymn in honour of the holy
       Sacrament) as soon as the cross covered with a purple veil
       appears: the last verses of it are sung in the Pauline
       chapel, which is splendidly illuminated. The cardinals
       bearing their mitres and torches precede two by two the Holy
       Father, who bare-headed and on foot carries the blessed
       Sacrament under a canopy supported by eight assistant
       bishops or protonotaries<a id="footnotetag67"
       name="footnotetag67"></a><a href="#footnote67"><sup>67</sup></a>.
       When the Pope reaches <span class="pagenum"><a name="page59"
       id="page59"></a>[pg 59]</span> the altar, the first cardinal
       deacon receives from His hands the B. Sacrament, and
       preceded by torches carries it to the upper part of the
       <i>macchina</i>; M. Sagrista places it within the urn
       commonly called the sepulchre, where it is incensed by the
       Pope; in the mean time the conclusion of the hymn is sung.
       M. Sagrista then shuts the sepulchre, and delivers the key
       to thy Card. Penitentiary, who is to officiate on the
       following day.</p>

    <p class="side">Reservation of the B. Sacrament.</p>

    <p>Two objects are obtained by this custom; 1st. the blessed
    sacrament is solemnly preserved for the adoration of the
    faithful on this anniversary of its institution, as well as for
    the priest's communion on good friday<a id="footnotetag68"
       name="footnotetag68"></a><a href="#footnote68"><sup>68</sup></a>;
       2nd. the burial of our divine Saviour is represented: this
       is anticipated, in order that the principal altar may be
       striped, in sign of mourning, and as He was stripped before
       His crucifixion.</p>

    <p class="side">Papal benediction: <i>flabelli</i>.</p>

    <p class="side">Bulla in Coena Domina.</p>

    <p>The procession, of which we have already spoken, afterwards
    proceeds from the Pauline chapel to the <i>loggia</i> in front
    of S. Peter's: but the Pope, as he no longer carries the B.
    Sacrament, wears his mitre, and is seated in his <i>sedia
    gestatoria</i> under a canopy carried by eight
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page60"
       id="page60"></a>[pg 60]</span>
       Referendarii<a id="footnotetag69"
       name="footnotetag69"></a><a href="#footnote69"><sup>69</sup></a>;
       and the <i>flabelli</i><a id="footnotetag70"
       name="footnotetag70"></a><a href="#footnote70"><sup>70</sup></a>
       are carried at each side of Him. He now gives his solemn
       benediction to the multitude assembled before St. Peter's.
       This however is repeated with even greater splendour on
       Easter-Sunday, as well as on the Ascension and Assumption;
       and we shall therefore reserve a description of it to
       another occasion, especially since generally speaking,
       persons who are anxious to witness the <i>lavanda</i> or
       washing of the feet will find it difficult to be present
       also at the Benediction<a id="footnotetag71"
       name="footnotetag71"></a><a href="#footnote71"><sup>71</sup></a>.</p><span class="pagenum">
    <a name="page61"
       id="page61"></a>[pg 61]</span>

    <p class="side">Washing of the feet.</p>

    <p>After the benediction, the cardinals and others take off
    their sacred vestments, and resume their <i>cappe</i>, which
    they wear during the <i>lavanda</i> or washing of the feet.
    This now takes place in S. Peters, in a side-chapel adorned
    with two <i>arazzi</i>; one representing Leonardo Da Vinci's
    last supper is placed behind the benches prepared for the
    priests whose feet are to be washed by the Pope: and the other,
    which represents Providence seated on the globe between Justice
    and Charity, above two lions holding banners of the church, is
    placed over the throne. The Pope is habited in a red cope, and
    wears a mitre. Seated on His throne, and surrounded by
    cardinals, prelates, and other dignitaries of His court, He
    puts incense into the thurible, being assisted as usual by the
    first Cardinal priest. He then gives the blessing, usual before
    the gospel is sung, to the Cardinal-deacon habited in his
    sacred vestments, who sings that beautiful passage of the
    gospel of S. John, which explains the origin of this ceremony:
    "Jesus knowing that his hour was come, that he should pass out
    of this world to the Father, having loved his own who were in
    the world, he loved them to the end. Knowing that the Father
    had given him all things into his hands, he began to wash the
    feet of his disciples, and wipe them with the towel wherewith
    he was girded, and he said to them; If I being Lord and Master
    have washed your feet, you also ought to wash one another's
    feet; for I have given you an example, that as I have done to
    you, so you do also". At the end of the gospel, the Pope kisses
    the book, the Cardinal Deacon incenses Him as usual, and the
    choir begins to sing beautiful anthems allusive to the
    affecting ceremony, and recommending charity, the distinctive
    virtue of Christians, more precious than even faith and hope.
    The Pope's cope is then taken off, and a towel is fastened to
    his girdle by the assisting Card. deacons; and then, in
    imitation of his Divine Master, he washes and kisses the

       <i>cappe</i> of white cloth, and wearing high cap, which in
       form resemble those on the bas-reliefs of Persepolis: each
       of them receives from Him a towel, and a nosegay, besides a
       gold and silver medal presented by the
       Treasurer<a id="footnotetag73"

    <p>His Holiness afterwards waits on the 13 <i>apostles</i> at
    table, in a hall in the Vatican palace, (at present in the hall
    above the portico of S. Peter's), giving them water to wash
    their hands, helping them to soup, one or more dishes, and
    pouring out wine and water for them once or twice. The plates
    are handed to Him by prelates of <i>mantelletta</i>, and during
    the ceremony one of His chaplains reads a spiritual book. He
    then gives them his blessing, washes His hands, and departs.
    "Which is greater" says our Saviour, "he that sitteth at table
    or he that serveth? Is not he that sitteth at table? but I am
    in the midst of you as he that
    serveth?"</p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page63"
       id="page63"></a>[pg 63]</span>

    <p class="side">Antiquity and meaning of the
    <i>lavanda</i>.</p>

    <p>From the most remote antiquity, it was customary among the
    Hebrews and other nations, that the feet of strangers and
    guests should be washed before they reclined at table, as they
    had often travelled on foot. Thus the angels entertained by
    Abraham and Lot (Gen. XVIII, XIX), were supplied with water to
    wash their feet: Abraham's servants in the house of Laban, and
    the brothers of Joseph, when received by him, washed their
    feet. (Gen. XLIII, 24)<a id="footnotetag75"
       name="footnotetag75"></a><a href="#footnote75"><sup>75</sup></a>.
       In these cases however the guest washed his own feet; and
       hence the condescension of our Divine Lord was an act not of
       hospitality or charity alone, but also of profound humility;
       and accordingly he put on a towel or apron, like an ordinary
       slave, as Ferrari observes (De Re Vestiaria par. 1). Most
       interpreters are of opinion, that Christ washed the feet of
       His disciples towards the close of the ordinary supper, and
       shortly before He instituted the holy Sacrament; in order to
       signify the purity with which it should be received. His
       example was imitated by His disciples, and accordingly S.
       Paul (1 Tim. V, 10) speaks of widows who "have washed the
       saints' feet," as Magdalen had washed those of our Lord.</p>

    <p>In the Roman church, as in that of Bologna, it has been for
    many ages customary for the Bishop to wash feet on this day. In
    the <i>Ordo Romanus</i> of Cencius Camerarius it is mentioned,
    that the Roman Pontiff after mass washed the feet of twelve
    subdeacons, and after dinner of 13 poor persons, or according
    to the Ordines Romani published by Mabillon, of 12 deacons. The
    <i>Ceremoniale</i>, attributed to Marcellus archbishop of
    Corcyra, prescribes that the Pope should wash the feet of
    thirteen poor men. <span class="pagenum"><a name="page64"
       id="page64"></a>[pg 64]</span> Various causes are assigned
       by different authors to explain, why the number is thirteen,
       and not twelve as was that of the apostles. (See Benedict
       XIV, De Festis, lib. I, c. VI, §§ 57, 58). The most probable
       account, we think, is that the thirteenth <i>apostle</i> was
       added in memory of the angel, who is believed to have
       appeared among the 12 poor guests of S. Gregory the great,
       while he was exercising united charity and humility. A
       painting of this event may be seen in one of the chapels
       near his church on the Cælian mount, in which is preserved
       the table, at which he daily fed twelve poor persons. (See
       the passage of John the deacon cited above in the note). The
       two customs of washing the feet first of 12, and then of 13,
       have been reduced to one, and in it the number 13 is
       preserved<a id="footnotetag76"

    <p class="side">Cardinals' public dinner.</p>

    <p>Till within the last few years the Cardinals used to dine in
    public at the Vatican on holy Thursday and good Friday, that
    they might be spared the trouble of returning to their
    respective palaces before Tenebræ; and anciently the Pope used
    to dine with them at the Lateran palace, in the hall called the
    Triclinium Leonianum<a id="footnotetag77"
       name="footnotetag77"></a><a href="#footnote77"><sup>77</sup></a>.
       The Pontiff wore on such occasions his cope and mitre, and
       the Cardinals were habited in sacred vestments with mitres.
       After dinner a sermon was preached before the Cardinals.
       <i>Mons. Maggiordomo</i> used to invite on these days
       prelates, officers, and others engaged in the
       <i>cappella</i> or palace, to a dinner at which he
       presided.</p>

    <p class="side">Tenebræ etc.</p>

    <p class="side">Recapitulation.</p>

    <p>In the afternoon, at the office of Tenebræ, among other
    signs of mourning, the cross is veiled in black, and the
    candles are of yellow wax: the Pope's throne is stripped of its
    usual ornaments, and is without a canopy: the cardinals' and
    prelates' benches also are without carpets. The Cardinal
    Penitentiary goes to S. Peter's, where the minor Penitentiaries
    are Conventuals of S. Francis. We
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page66"
       id="page66"></a>[pg 66]</span> have spoken on these subjects
       in the preceding chapters. We may here recapitulate the
       principal ceremonies of the day, as Morcelli has done in his
       Calendar. The oils are blessed in S. Peter's; the Pope
       assists at mass in the Sixtine chapel, carries the B.
       Sacrament to the Pauline chapel, gives His solemn
       benediction from S. Peter's, washes the feet of thirteen
       priests and serves them at table. In the afternoon Tenebrae
       in the Sixtine chapel; and the Cardinal great Penitentiary
       goes to S Peter's.</p>

    <p class="side">S. Peter's on holy thursday-evening.</p>

    <p>In this basilic the B. Sacrament is preserved amid many
    lights in the <i>Sepulchre</i> in a
    side-chapel<a id="footnotetag78"
       name="footnotetag78"></a><a href="#footnote78"><sup>78</sup></a>,
       and several confraternities come in procession to venerate
       the relics, of which we shall speak in the next chapter. It
       is much to be regretted that the cross, which used on
       holy-Thursday and good-Friday to glow with 628
       lights<a id="footnotetag79"
       name="footnotetag79"></a><a href="#footnote79"><sup>79</sup></a>,
       and to produce a splendid effect by the <i>chiaroscuro</i>
       which resulted from it in this vast and magnificent fabric,
       is no longer suspended before the Confession, in consequence
       of irreverent conduct on preceding occasions.</p>

    <p class="side">Washing of the altar.</p>

    <p>There still remains another remarkable ceremony customary in
    S. Peter's on holy-Thursday. After the office of Tenebræ, the
    chapter of that basilica proceeds in procession from the chapel
    of the choir to the high altar. The black stoles which six of
    the canons wear, and the yellow and extinguished tapers of the
    acolythes, are signs of mourning for the sufferings of Christ.
    They all carry elegant <i>aspergilli</i><a id="footnotetag80"
       name="footnotetag80"></a><a href="#footnote80"><sup>80</sup></a>
       of box or other wood, and having
       <span class="pagenum"><a name="page67"
       id="page67"></a>[pg 67]</span> prayed for a short time in
       silence, they chant the anthem "They divided my garments
       etc." and the psalm "O God, my God, why hast thou abandoned
       me?" A fine cloth, which covered the altar, is then removed
       from it, and the Cardinal-priest of the church and the six
       canons pour whine upon the altar, and wash it with their
       <i>aspergilli</i> or brushes. After the other canons,
       beneficed clergymen, etc. have in turn washed it in like
       manner: the Cardinal and the six canons begin to dry it with
       sponges and towels: all then kneel down, and the ceremony
       concludes with the verse "Christ became obedient unto death
       etc." the Our Father, and the prayer of the day "Look down,
       we beseech thee etc."<a id="footnotetag81"
       name="footnotetag81"></a><a href="#footnote81"><sup>81</sup></a>
       The chapter then venerates the relics shewn as usual from
       the gallery above S. Veronica's statue.</p>

    <p class="side">Antiquity and meaning of these ceremonies.</p>

    <p>The <i>stripping</i> of the altars, which is practised on
    this day throughout the western church, is mentioned in the
    most ancient <i>Ordo Romanus</i>: indeed anciently the altars
    used to be stripped every day, as Du Vert (Ceremon. de l'Eglise
    T. IV.) and Cancellieri (De Secretariis T. IV.) have shewn. The
    custom of <i>washing</i> the altar is observed in the Latin
    church in those of the Dominicans and Carmelites; and also
    according to Benedict XIV "in many churches of France, Germany
    and other remote countries"
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page68"
       id="page68"></a>[pg 68]</span> among which Cancellieri
       reckons Spain. It is mentioned by S. Isidore (lib. de
       Eccles. Offic. c. 18) by Alcuin (de divinis offic.) and in
       the Sarum, Parisian and many other missals quoted by
       Martene. What however is its meaning? While Monsignor
       Battelli, in his dissertation on the subject, maintains that
       this custom was instituted for the sake of cleanliness,
       rather than from a wish to denote any mystery, and that this
       day was selected as the most convenient, because the altars
       were already stripped; the abbot Rupert and Belet discover
       mystical meanings in the sponges, towels, wine, water, and
       even <i>aspergilli</i>. We prefer a middle course, and while
       we are willing to admit with Durandus and others an allusion
       in the wine and water to the blood and water which flowed
       from our Saviour on the cross, we maintain with the learned
       S. Isidore, S. Eligius, Benedict XIV and others, that we
       wash the altar, the symbol of Christ, from motives of
       respect to Him, who on this day washed the feet of His
       disciples.</p>

    <p>Two great virtues are embodied in the ceremonies of this
    day, and impart to them their life and loveliness: they are the
    essential and characteristic virtues of Christians, by the
    practice of which they imitate their divine Master and model,
    and come at last to be united to Him in heaven. Christ was
    moved by charity to institute the Holy Sacrament, and by
    humility to wash His disciples feet. Let us then learn of him
    because He was meek and humble of heart, and let us love one
    another, because Christ hath first loved us, and commands us to
    love one another.</p>

        <p>Only one priest says mass in each on this day and the
        other priests communicate, as on it Christ alone said mass,
        and distributed the Holy communion to the apostles.
        Although for many centuries both kinds were ordinarily
        received, yet the custom of communicating under the form of
        bread alone is very ancient. Thus in time of persecution
        the faithful used to carry to their houses the holy
        communion under the form of bread alone, the hermits also
        preserved it in the deserts, the sick received it as their
        viaticum, the ministers of God kept it in the churches, for
        their spiritual support, and the bishops used to send it to
        their clergy in token of their union in charity. These were
        all instances of communion under one kind, which are
        enumerated and proved by many Catholic divines, as for
        instance by Dr. Rock in his Hierurgia. They demonstrate the
        constant belief of the church, that the whole sacrament is
        received under one kind only; and Christ himself in the
        scriptures attributes its admirable effects to the act of
        <i>eating</i> only as well as to that of <i>eating and
        drinking</i>. "He that eateth this bread shall live for
        ever" etc. In fact since His resurrection "He dieth now no
        more": His body and blood and soul and Divinity are united
        together for evermore, and consequently the communicant
        receives under the form of bread alone Christ himself whole
        and entire. The Latin church prescribed the general
        reception of communion under one kind, in order to obviate
        accidents which frequently arose from the indiscriminate
        use of the chalice, and in opposition to the error of the
        Hussites: Thus Paul II took occasion from the presence of
        Frederic III at Rome, to give a public and illustrious
        proof of the condemnation of this new heresy by the church,
        by giving communion under one kind only to the Emperor, and
        also to the deacon and subdeacon, who generally communicate
        under both kinds when the Pope sings mass. In the Greek and
        other oriental churches communion is administered under one
        kind to the sick and others who are prevented by distance
        from communicating in the churches. The general communion
        customary on holy-thursday is prescribed by the English
        bishop Walter in the 10th century, in the capitulary of
        Theodulph of Orleans, and by all ancient pontificals and
        missals, according to Martene T. 3, p. 98. It is practised
        also by the Greeks, as Leo Allatius testifies. De consensu
        utriusque Ecclesiæ lib. 3. Palmer (Vol. 2. p. 76) says "It
        is not essential to the validity of the Sacrament, that the
        bread should be whole and entire before consecration, and
        broken afterwards: but the Universal practice of the
        Christian church, derived from the apostles and from Jesus
        Christ himself ought not to be infringed in this matter".
        Yet even Bp. Middleton whom he quotes in the same page,
        says "When there were many communicants, <i>in primitive
        times, there were several cakes or loaves</i>, in
        proportion to the number: and it took some time after the
        consecration was finished, to break and divide them for
        distribution". Each person communicated from his own
        offering: hence S. Augustine says "Erubescere debet homo
        idoneus si de aliena oblatione communicaverit" Serm. 215 de
        Temp, any longer justification of the general practice of
        the Roman church would therefore be superfluous.</p>

        <p>These <i>troccole</i> were formerly called by the hard
        names of <i>crepitacula ligna congregantia, mallei

        proves from a libellus de miraculis Anastasii presented to
        the second council of Nice, from S. John Chrysostom's life
        by Metaphrastes etc. etc. In modern times also they
        continue to use them. Benedict XIV observes that the

        preserve the remembrance of the ancient custom. It is also
        evidently intended, like the reversed arms of the soldiers,
        as a sign of mourning for the death of Christ. This silence
        of the bells is prescribed in the ancient rituals: mystical

        <p>This mass is found in the Antiphonary and Sacramentary
        of Pope Gregory the great; in all churches but the Roman,
        as Marlene observes, vespers were joined with the mass on
        this day, as they are on holy Saturday throughout the Latin
        church. On holy-thursday the Pope used generally to preach
        after the gospel, and in the mean time the Cardinals
        stripped the altar: after the sermon the Pope blessed the
        people as usual, and then began the <i>Credo</i>, according
        to Benedict, Canon of S. Peter's. His Holiness drank on
        this day directly from the chalice, and did not use the
        golden reed or <i>fistola</i>, as on other occasions; this
        we learn from the Apamean Pontifical.</p>

        <p>This chapel was erected by Paul III according to the
        design of Antonio Sangallo. Its two large frescoes are the
        last efforts of the genius of Michelangelo, then aged 75
        years: they represent the crucifixion of S. Peter and the
        conversion of S. Paul. The fall of Simon Magus, and the
        baptism conferred by S. Peter, painted on the
        righthand-wall are works of Federico Zuccheri; on the
        opposite side S. Paul at Malta, and restoring the young
        man, who had fallen from a window, are by Lorenzo Sabbatino
        da Bologna, the ceiling was painted by Federico Zuccheri.
        The B. Sacrament is publicly and solemnly exposed in this
        chapel for the adoration of the faithful on the first
        Sunday of Advent as well as on holy-thursday See Chaltard;

        <p>S. John Chrysostom established processions at
        Constantinople in opposition to those of the Arians; and
        the empress Eudoxia supplied the people with silver crosses
        and wax lights, to be carried on such occasions. Socrat.
        Hist. Eccl. lib. VI, c. 8, Sozomen lib. VIII, c. 8.
        Processions were incompatible with the persecutions of the
        first three centuries. During them, and even long after
        Constantine, in consequence of the discipline of secrecy,
        there was neither public exposition or procession of the B.
        Sacrament. The faithful however adored it privately, as for
        instance, S. Gregory Nazianzen relates of his sister
        Gorgonia, that when seized by a fever "she fell down with
        faith before the altar, and invoked with a loud cry Him who
        is honoured thereupon". (Discourse on her funeral). S.
        Cyril of Jerusalem also exhorts the believer, that when he
        receives the chalice of the blood of Christ he should bow
        down profoundly and adore. (Catech. 5), The office and mass
        of Corpus Christi were composed by S. Thomas Aquinas. As
        holy-thursday is in great part devoted to the sufferings of
        Christ, the festival of <i>Corpus Christi</i> with its
        procession was instituted about the middle of the
        thirteenth century by Urban IV at the petition of B.
        Juliana of Mount <i>Cornelione</i>, and in consequence of
        the miracle of Bolsena, well known as the subject of one of
        Raffaello's frescoes in the Vatican. See Bened. XIV, De
        Festis, and the authors cited by him. The miraculous
        corporal stained with blood is still preserved at Orvieto,
        the celebrated cathedral of which owes its foundation to
        the miracle. "No one eats that flesh, says S. Augustine,
        unless he has first adored" in ps. 98 "The flesh of
        Christ," says S. Ambrose "which we adore even now in the
        mysteries, and which the apostles adored in the Lord Jesus"
        (de Spir. S. lib. 34, c. 12) All the fathers and liturgies
        mention this adoration, which was therefore derived from
        apostolic tradition. Sala ad Bonæ lib. 2, c. 13.</p>

        <p>In the Greek church communion is on this day reserved
        for the sick of the ensuing year under the form of bread
        alone, according to Leo Allatius. (De utriusque Ecclesiæ
        consensione). Pope Innocent I in the beginning of the 5th
        century directs, that the eucharist be preserved on this
        day for the priest and the sick. This reservation is
        mentioned also in the Gregorian sacramentary, without any
        mention of the sacred blood, since it might be spilt. It
        has taken place in the Pauline chapel ever since its
        erection by Paul III. A particle of the B. Sacrament was
        formerly preserved after mass on festivals and carried back
        in procession to the sacristy: it was carried to the altar
        in procession on the next festival, and a portion or the
        whole of it was put into the chalice before the host was
        broken. See Cancellieri, De Secretariis T. I, p. 217,
        seq.</p>

        <p>Since the time of Clement XIV, the custom of reading
        from the <i>loggia</i> on this day the bull in <i>Coena
        Domini</i> has been abolished. (On this bull see de Maistre
        du Pape lib. 2, c. 14). According to the doctrine of S.
        Paul, the B. Sacrament is the bond as it is the symbol of
        union or <i>communion</i> between the faithful; "We being
        many are one body, all who partake of one bread" 1 Cor. X,
        17, and hence this day of its institution was selected for
        the public <i>excommunication</i> of those, who reject the
        doctrines of the church, or maliciously oppose her
        ordinances. After the bull had been read "many candles are
        lighted, of which the Lord Pope himself holds some, and
        each cardinal and prelate one lighted, and he extinguishes
        and throws them on the ground, saying, we excommunicate all
        the aforesaid; and then the bells are rung together without
        observing any order". Ap. Gatticuin, Acta Cerem. 82. These
        ceremonies are interpreted to mean the <i>extinction of the
        grace</i> of the holy Ghost; and the dispersion of
        unbelievers, as on the contrary the regular and orderly
        ringing of bells calls the faithful together.</p>

        this ceremony, the Cardinal Dean supplies his place in

        <p>The emperors of Costantinople used (according to Codinus
        De Officiis Aulæ Costantinop.) to wash the feet of twelve
        poor persons: and Vespasiano Fiorentino in the fifteenth
        century, in his life of Alfonso di Napoli quoted by
        Cancellieri, says that "Il Giovedi Santo lavava i piedi a
        tanti poveri, quant' egli aveva anni, et lavavagli, come si
        deve ... et a tutti dava una veste bianca, et un pajo di
        calze, et un Alfonsino, et un fiorino et un carlino, et non
        so che altra moneta. Dipoi il Giovedi medesímo faceva
        ordinare una cena,... et la Maestà del Re la pigliava, et
        metteva loro innanzi, e con il vino, et quello avevano di
        bisogno con grandissima umiltà". See also Martene, De Ant.
        Eccl. Rit. Lib. IV, c. XII, § 8. Our readers will here call
        to mind the good old custom still preserved of the maundy
        of our British Sovereigns, so called from mandatum, the
        first word of the first anthem sung during, the washing of
        the feet. In the Greek church, according to Baillet, not
        only are the feet of twelve poor persons washed, but the
        name of an apostle is given to each of them; as it may be
        supposed, nobody is anxious to have the name of Judas
        Iscariot: so lots are drawn to determine the person who is
        to represent that traitor. This may remind us of the threat
        of Leonardo da Vinci to copy the head of Judas, in his
        celebrated last supper, from the importunate Prior of S.
        Maria delle Grazie of Milan. Poor Leonardo despaired of
        finding a model for the head of our Saviour; and for more
        than a year was seeking the rabble for a fit subject whom
        he might represent as Judas: meantime the Prior was
        continually worrying him to finish the fresco. "In ogni
        caso poi" said he to Lodovico Sforza, "faro capitale del
        ritratto del P. Priore, che lo merita per la sua
        importunità e per la sua poca discrezione". The story of
        Leonardo bears some resemblance to the manner in which
        Michelangelo punished Biagio da Cesena Pontifical Master of
        Ceremonies, who before Daniel of Volterra had acquired his
        well-known nickname of <i>braghettone</i> complained to the
        Pope, that the naked figures of the last judgment were
        unworthy of a house of prayer. The artist introduced his
        censor in his painting as Minos judge of the infernal
        regions, with long ears like those of the other devils, and
        a serpent's tail. Paul III when appealed to is said to have
        answered, that if his Ceremoniere had been in Purgatory, he
        might have helped him out, but out of hell there was no
        redemption. This Papal witticism Platner could not find in
        any writer earlier than Richardson (See Beschreibung der
        Stadt Rom) but <i>se non è vero, è ben trovato</i>. Dante
        was not more scrupulous than Michelangelo about thrusting
        his opponents into his <i>inferno</i>.</p>

        that of stripping the altars on holy Thursday, when

        wine and on good Friday, when blood and water flowed from

    <p>On good Friday the Pope used formerly to go with the
    Cardinals and the other members of the court to the Oratory of
    S. Lorenzo called <i>Sancta Sanctorum</i> in the Lateran
    palace, where they venerated and kissed the relics of SS. Peter
    and Paul, as well as two crosses preserved there. One of these
    was then carried by a Cardinal Priest, and
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page70"
       id="page70"></a>[pg 70]</span> and the Host consecrated on
       the preceding day was borne by another Cardinal of the same
       order; the Pope, the Cardinals and all the others were
       bare-footed, and walked in procession reciting psalms to S.
       John Lateran's and thence to S. Croce, where the station was
       held and the ceremonies of the day were

    manner the Bishops do not wear rings and their stockings are
    black: those of the Cardinals are purple; and the maces as well
    as the soldiers' arms are reversed. The Card. great
    Penitentiary with the sacred ministers are habited in black.
    There is no thurifer and there are no lights; for the death of
    the Son of God is going to be commemorated; and while He was
    hanging upon the cross and when He died, there was darkness
    over the whole earth. The Pope is habited in a red cope: he
    does not wear his ring nor give his blessing: but if he be
    present at this part of the service, His Holiness kneeling with
    the Card. Penitentiary at his left hand offers up prayers for a
    short time before the altar. This, which was stripped on the
    preceding day, <span class="pagenum"><a name="page71"
       id="page71"></a>[pg 71]</span> is now covered with a linen
       cloth by two <i>Cerimonieri</i><a id="footnotetag83"
       name="footnotetag83"></a><a href="#footnote83"><sup>83</sup></a>.
       The Pope then goes to His seat; and the Card. Celebrant
       accompanied by the ministers to the altar, and thence to his
       <i>faldistorio</i> or seat. An appropriate passage from the
       prophecy of Osee is sung by one of the choir, and the
       precept from Exodus concerning the killing of the
       paschal-lamb, a type of Christ, by the subdeacon. The Pope
       and the Card. Celebrant also read both these lessons, after
       each of which a tract is sung by the choir; and between them
       a prayer by the Celebrant. After the prophecies, which are a
       powerful confirmation of the truth of our holy religion, the
       account of the sufferings and death of Jesus Christ, penned
       by an eye-witness S. John, the disciple of love, is
       recited<a id="footnotetag84"
       name="footnotetag84"></a><a href="#footnote84"><sup>84</sup></a>.
       It is read in a low voice by the Card. Celebrant and sung
       with the same impressive chant as on Palm-Sunday by three
       cantors wearing the alb, a black maniple and stole: they
       used formerly to recite it bare-footed. At those words "And
       bowing down his head he gave up the ghost" all kneel to
       adore their Redeemer. It is related of a servant of God of
       the name of Piccolomini, that he expired in church on good
       Friday when those words were sung. The latter part is
       chanted, but without the usual ceremonies, by the deacon,
       after he has taken off his folded chasuble and put on the
       large band or stole. A short sermon is then preached by a
       conventual Friar, who afterwards according to custom
       publishes the indulgence or remission of temporal punishment
       of thirty years granted by the Pope to those who have
       confessed and sincerely repented of their sins. See p. 37.

    <p class="side">Prayers for all mankind.</p>

    <p>Christ, says S. Paul, died for all men, and when suffering
    on the cross, He prayed even for his relentless persecutors: on
    the anniversary then of his death it is fit that His church
    should pray for all men, that all may be saved by the
    application of His merits to their souls. The Card. Celebrant
    commences the beautiful, charitable, and ancient prayers of
    this day with the words, Let us pray, dearly beloved, for the
    holy church of God etc. The deacon then kneeling says
    (according to the ancient custom mentioned by S. Cesarius of
    Arles in his 36th homily, and by S. Basil in his book on the
    Holy Ghost c. XXVII) Let us bend our knees, and the subdeacon
    answers, Stand up, as it was customary to pray standing. This
    form is repeated before each prayer, except that which is
    offered for the Jews<a id="footnotetag85"
       name="footnotetag85"></a><a href="#footnote85"><sup>85</sup></a>:
       for their soldiers, bowing the knee before our Lord, mocked
       him saying in derision, Hail king of the Jews. Prayers
       follow for the Pope, for all the clergy, and holy people of
       God (formerly for the Emperor also) and catechumens who are
       to receive baptism on the day following. Having prayed for
       all members of the church, we then pray for heretics and
       schismatics, that God may deign to "deliver them from all
       errors, and bring them back to their holy mother the
       catholic and apostolic church"; and these petitions are
       followed by others for the conversion of Jews and
       Pagans<a id="footnotetag86"

       the officiating Cardinal takes off his chasuble, and going
       to the epistle-side of the altar receives from the deacon
       the crucifix<a id="footnotetag88"

       Then turning towards the people, and uncovering the upper
       part of the crucifix, he sings, Behold the wood of the
       cross, on which hung the salvation
       <span class="pagenum"><a name="page75"
       id="page75"></a>[pg 75]</span> of the world; in singing
       which words he is joined by two tenor-voices from the choir.
       The choir answers, Come, let us adore<a id="footnotetag89"
       name="footnotetag89"></a><a href="#footnote89"><sup>89</sup></a>.
       The Pope and all others kneel,
       <span class="pagenum"><a name="page76"
       id="page76"></a>[pg 76]</span> except the Cardinal
       celebrant, who advances nearer to the middle of the altar,
       and uncovers the right arm of the crucifix, and repeats the
       same words in a higher tone, and
       <span class="pagenum"><a name="page77"
       id="page77"></a>[pg 77]</span> again in a still higher tone
       before the middle of the altar, where he uncovers the whole
       cross. The choir answers as before, and all except the
       celebrant kneel each time the words are repeated. The
       Cardinal then places the crucifix on a rich cushion lying on
       the steps of the altar<a id="footnotetag90"
       name="footnotetag90"></a><a href="#footnote90"><sup>90</sup></a>.</p>

    <p class="side">Trisagion.</p>

    <p>I observed above, that it was formerly customary for the
    Pope and all others to walk bare-footed in the procession of
    this day, as others royal personages have done; for instance,
    S. Louis of France, S. Elisabeth of Hungary, and others. Thus
    to be barefooted was a sign of mourning (1 Sam. XV, 30. Jer.
    II, 25) among the Jews. Their priests were without shoes at
    their functions, in token of reverence (Exod. III, 5. Jos. V,
    15). Some memorial of this practice is preserved in the present
    custom of taking off the shoes of the principal persons who
    revere and kiss the cross on this day. The Pope's shoes are
    taken off by an <i>Ajutante di Camera</i>, His cope by
    acolythes (<i>Votanti di Segnatura</i>), and afterwards His
    Holiness then makes three profound genuflections before the
    crucifix, gradually approaching nearer to it, and then kisses
    it in token of his love for Him, who died upon it for our
    salvation<a id="footnotetag91"
       name="footnotetag91"></a><a href="#footnote91"><sup>91</sup></a>.
       He <span class="pagenum"><a name="page78"
       id="page78"></a>[pg 78]</span> also empties a purse,
       containing an offering of 100 <i>scudi d'oro</i>, into a
       silver basin near the crucifix. When the Pope is about to
       make the first genuflection, the choir begins to sing the
       <i>improperii</i>, the sentiments of which, and the chant
       composed by Palestrina <a id="footnotetag92"
       name="footnotetag92"></a><a href="#footnote92"><sup>92</sup></a>,
       are admirably adapted to the pathetic ceremony. In them God
       enumerates the unparalleled benefits which he lavished upon
       the Jews, and the atrocious crimes by which they repaid Him.
       At the end of each <i>improperium</i> or reproach, the
       Trisagion is sung by one choir in Greek, and in Latin by
       another "Holy God! Holy strong one! Holy immortal, have
       mercy on us"<a id="footnotetag93"
       name="footnotetag93"></a><a href="#footnote93"><sup>93</sup></a>.
       The Pope then returns to his throne; he resumes
       <span class="pagenum"><a name="page79"
       id="page79"></a>[pg 79]</span> his previous vestments and
       reads the <i>improperii</i> from the Missal held as usual by
       an assist. bishop kneeling. The Cardinal celebrant and all
       the other members of the sacred college, after their shoes
       have been taken off, assisted by the <i>Ceremonieri</i>
       revere and kiss the crucifix in the same manner as the Pope
       has done; and each of them leaves an offering of a <i>scudo
       d'oro</i> according to an ancient
       custom.<a id="footnotetag94"
       name="footnotetag94"></a><a href="#footnote94"><sup>94</sup></a>
       When they return to their places, their shoes are put on by
       their respective <i>camerieri</i>, who afterwards leave the
       chapel. The patriarchs and bishops assistant and
       non-assistant and the generals of religious orders without
       shoes, and all the other prelates etc. wearing their shoes,
       <i>adore</i> and kiss the cross in like manner, observing
       the same order as in going to receive palms on the preceding
       sunday; and they also make their offerings before the cross.
       When the sacred college has finished the <i>adoration</i>,
       the choir having ended the <i>improperii</i> sings the
       anthem <i>Crucem tuam</i>, the psalm <i>Deus misereatur
       nostri</i>, the hymn <i>Pange lingua gloriosi lauream
       certaminis</i><a id="footnotetag95"
       name="footnotetag95"></a><a href="#footnote95"><sup>95</sup></a>

       ceremony the candles are lighted, the deacon spreads out the

       respectfully takes the cross, and places it on the altar
       amid the candlesticks.</p>

    <p class="side">Chant of <i>Pange lingua</i> etc.</p>

    <p>A procession, arranged like that of the preceding day, now
    goes to the Pauline chapel. Assisted as usual by the first
    Card. priest, the Pope kneels and incenses the B. Sacrament
    three times. <i>M. Sagrista</i> delivers the B. Sacrament to
    the Cardinal celebrant, who presents it to the Pope; His
    Holiness covers it with the end of the veil placed over his
    shoulders<a id="footnotetag97"
       name="footnotetag97"></a><a href="#footnote97"><sup>97</sup></a>
       and the procession returns to the Sixtine chapel
       <a id="footnotetag98"
       name="footnotetag98"></a><a href="#footnote98"><sup>98</sup></a>.
       In the mean time the choir sings the hymn "<i>Vexilla Regis
       prodeunt</i>". When the Pope arrives at the altar, he
       delivers the B. Sacrament to the Card. Celebrant, who places
       it on the altar. His Holiness then incenses it and returns
       to his throne.</p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page81"
       id="page81"></a>[pg 81]</span>

    <p>During the procession the crucifix on the altar of the
    Sixtine chapel is removed, and a larger cross containing a
    considerable relic of the true cross is substituted for it.
    This relic was sent to Pope Leo the Great in the 5th century by
    Juvenal Bishop of Jerusalem. It was lost, but found again by
    Pope Sergius I in 687: it was stolen at the sack of Rome in
    1527, and removed from its case of silver: however it was
    recovered by Clement VII, who ordered the rich cross, in which
    it is at present preserved, to be made: in 1730 it was again
    stolen but recovered once more by Clement XII. At the close of
    the last century, though the candlesticks, and the statues of
    the Apostles belonging to the papal chapel were lost, this
    cross was preserved. In 1840 His present Holiness Gregory XVI
    ordered it to be again exposed to the public veneration in the
    Sixtine chapel: He gave it to the charge of the chapter of S.
    Peter's, who deliver it to <i>M. Sagrista</i> on Good-friday
    morning: and it remains in the Sixtine chapel till the end of
    Tenebrae on that day. Moroni <i>Cappelle Pontificie
    etc.</i></p>

    <p>The <i>Mass</i> of the <i>Presanctified</i>, as it is
    called, is next celebrated; Card. Tommasi, following S.
    Cesarius of Arles, calls it the office, and not the mass of
    good-Friday; for mass, strictly speaking, is not offered up on
    this day, since no consecration takes place, and the B.
    Sacrament is received by the celebrant under the form of bread
    alone, as it could not be preserved with safety under the form
    of wine<a id="footnotetag99"
       name="footnotetag99"></a><a href="#footnote99"><sup>99</sup></a>.</p><span class="pagenum">

       id="page82"></a>[pg 82]</span>

    <p class="side">Mass of the Pre-Sanctified.</p>

    <p>The Card. Celebrant places the B. Sacrament on the
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page83"
       id="page83"></a>[pg 83]</span> paten<a id="footnotetag100"
       name="footnotetag100"></a><a href="#footnote100"><sup>100</sup></a>
       and thence on the corporal. In the meantime the deacon puts
       wine into the chalice, and the subdeacon water, which
       however are neither blessed or
       consecrated<a id="footnotetag101"
       name="footnotetag101"></a><a href="#footnote101"><sup>101</sup></a>
       on this day. The cardinal then places the chalice on the
       altar, and the deacon covers it with the <i>palla</i> or
       pall (a small square piece of linen, which serves to prevent
       flies etc. from falling into it). The Cardinal incenses the
       offerings and the altar, washes his hands, and recites the
       <i>Orate Fratres</i> and Our Father. All then kneel to adore
       the blessed Sacrament, which he raises over the paten. He
       <span class="pagenum"><a name="page84"
       id="page84"></a>[pg 84]</span> divides it as usual, but
       without saying any prayer <a id="footnotetag102"
       name="footnotetag102"></a><a href="#footnote102"><sup>102</sup></a>,
       into three parts, putting one of them into the chalice.
       Striking his breast, and acknowledging his own unworthiness,
       he receives communion, taking the sacred host, and
       afterwards the consecrated particle with the wine in the
       chalice <a id="footnotetag103"
       name="footnotetag103"></a><a href="#footnote103"><sup>103</sup></a>.
       He then receives the ablution, washes his hands, and returns
       to the sacristy with the sacred ministers.</p>

    <p class="side">Vespers.</p>

    <p>Anciently on fasting days nothing was allowed to be eaten
    till sunset; and Vespers used therefore to be said before
    dinner: now that the one meal allowed on such days may be eaten
    as early as noon, the ancient practice of saying Vespers before
    dinner is still preserved. Vespers are therefore sung
    immediately after the mass of the Presanctified: they consist
    of the Our Father and Hail Mary said in secret, of five psalms
    with their anthems, and the <i>Magnificat</i> with its anthem.
    At the verse 'Christ became obedient unto death', all kneel
    down to adore Him, and the <i>Miserere</i> and the usual prayer
    are recited, but without the solemnity of

    of our blessed Lord in the tomb. When it is
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page85"
       id="page85"></a>[pg 85]</span> finished, the Pope wearing
       his stole, and the Cardinals having taken off their
       <i>cappe</i>, go to S. Peter's in procession, accompanied by
       the Papal <i>Anticamera segreta</i>, the guards and others,
       to venerate the relics of the Cross, the Lance, and the
       <i>Volto Santo</i>, which are shewn by the Canons from the
       gallery above the statue of S. Veronica
       <a id="footnotetag105"
       name="footnotetag105"></a><a href="#footnote105"><sup>105</sup></a>.
       The Pope meantime, and the Cardinals and others arranged on
       each side of Him, remain kneeling. The Pontifical cross is
       borne as usual before the Pope, when going to S. Peter's by
       an <i>Uditore di Rota</i>, and when returning to His
       apartments by His cross-bearer who is one of His
       chaplains.</p>

    <p class="side">Grounds of belief in relics.</p>

    <p>Catholics are bound to believe with divine faith only those
    doctrines, which the church defines to be doctrines taught by
    God; and hence with regard to particular images or relics or
    miracles, concerning which Christ has taught nothing, they
    believe them to be genuine or reject them, according to the
    evidence which accompanies them. We shall therefore briefly
    examine what evidence there is in favour of the relics in
    question.</p>

    <p class="side">1. Relic of the cross.</p>

    <p>1. The relic of the cross was placed here in 1629 by Urban
    VIII; but it was formed of some pieces taken from the churches
    of S. Anastasia and S. Croce in Gerusalemme. The Jews were
    accustomed to bury the instruments of punishment in or near the
    place where the persons executed were buried; but on this
    subject I must content myself with referring to Baronius,
    Calmet, Menochius, Gretser etc. who cite the Rabbins in proof
    of this assertion. Now according to the ancient historians,
    Eusebius, Sozomen and Socrates: the Emperor Adrian erected a
    temple <span class="pagenum"><a name="page86"
       id="page86"></a>[pg 86]</span> of Venus over the tomb of the
       God of purity, after he had covered it with a great quantity
       of rubbish. Helen the saintly mother of the emperor
       Costantine, after many searches (according to Eusebius in
       his life of that emperor) at length discovered the sacred
       tomb, in which was found, according to Sozomen, the
       inscription placed over the cross by Pilate, "Jesus of
       Nazareth, King of the Jews"<a id="footnotetag106"
       name="footnotetag106"></a><a href="#footnote106"><sup>106</sup></a>.
       Near the tomb in another part of the cave were found three
       crosses: but here a difficulty arose on which of these three
       was our Saviour crucified? At the suggestion of Macarius Bp.
       of Jerusalem, a woman at the point of death, as Ruffinus,
       Socrates, Theodoret, Sozomen and Nicephorus relate; or a
       dead man, according to Paulinus and Severus Sulpicius, was
       brought to the spot, and restored to health or to life, when
       placed on <i>one</i> of the three crosses. If we consider,
       that it is related in the 2nd book of Kings c, XIII, that
       when some persons "were burying a man, they cast the body
       into the sepulchre of Eliseus. And when it had touched the
       bones of Eliseus, the man came to life and stood up on his
       feet," we may not be unwilling to admit the possibility or
       probability, that such a miracle may have occurred at the
       sepulchre of the God of Eliseus. Besides the authors whom I
       have mentioned, this history is attested by S. Ambrose, S.
       Chrysostom, and S. Cyril of Jerusalem. This great bishop and
       Eusebius lived at the time when the event is said to have
       happened: the other writers lived not long after, and
       Ruffinus and Theodoret passed part of their lives in Syria.
       The same historians mention, that S. Helen divided the Cross
       into three parts, one she left in Jerusalem, another she
       sent <span class="pagenum"><a name="page87"
       id="page87"></a>[pg 87]</span> to Costantine, according to
       the author of the life of Pope Sylvester published by Pope
       Damasus towards the close of the 6th cent.; and the third
       she reserved for herself, to Rome. She placed the last
       mentioned piece in the Sessorian Basilica, called also the
       Basilica of Helen, because erected by her, in the Horti
       Variani: hence is derived its title of S. Croce in
       Gerusalemme. On this subject additional information may be
       found in the work of the late Padre De Corrieris, De
       Sessorianis praecipius D.N.J.C. reliquiis, in Trombelli De
       cultu SSrum and Ben. XIV. De festis. From Santa Croce a
       piece of the cross was taken to S. Peter's, and is one of
       the relics shewn on good friday. Even in the fourth century
       S. Cyril of Jerusalem testifies, that particles of the true
       cross had been sent to every Christian country.</p>

    <p class="side">2. of the lance.</p>

    <p>2. The lance also with which our divine Saviour's side was
    pierced, was found by S. Helen, as the Bollandists shew: and it
    was preserved in Jerusalem, as S. Gregory of Tours and our
    venerable Bede observe: but towards the end of the 6th cent.,
    the iron part of it was transfered to Costantinople; of this
    the point was placed in the imperial palace; the other part in
    the church of S. Sophia, and afterwards in that of S. John.
    William of Tyre and Anna Comnena mention it as existing there
    in the 11th and 12th centuries. Towards the close of the 13th
    century the point of the lance with other relics passed into
    the possession of S. Louis of France: the other part of the
    lance still remained at S. John's in Constantinople, as
    Buondelmount, who saw it, bears witness. When Mahomet subdued
    Costantinople, he preserved all the relics, as Theodore cited
    by Benedict XIV relates in his history of the Turks, and his
    son Bajazet sent an ambassador with the relics of the lance to
    Pope Innocent VIII, in order to induce his Holiness not to
    protect Zizimus, who disputed with him the succession to the
    Turkish <span class="pagenum"><a name="page88"
       id="page88"></a>[pg 88]</span> throne. The Pope received it
       with great reverence, and placed it in the Vatican. As some
       suspicion was entertained about the veracity of the Turkish
       ambassador, Benedict XIV, as he mentions in his very learned
       work on the Canonisation of the Saints, from which I have
       extracted this account, sent for an exact cast of the point
       preserved at Paris, which perfectly corresponded with the
       piece preserved in the Vatican; and thus were confirmed the
       assertion of the Turk<a id="footnotetag107"

    <p>3. As for the <i>Volto Santo</i>, or image of our Saviour it
    was placed in an Oratory of the Vatican Basilica by John VII as
    long ago as 707, as may be seen in Marlinetti, Dei pregii della
    Basilica Vat. Who S. Veronica or Berenice was, who is said to
    have wiped our Saviour's face with the handkerchief is another
    question, as Benedict XIV observes, to whom and to Marlinetti I
    shall content myself with referring. It appears that this
    ancient likeness of our Saviour was afterwards kept at S.
    Spirito: six Roman noblemen had the care of it; and to each of
    them was confided on of the six keys, with which it was locked
    up. They enjoyed various privileges, and among others, says an
    ancient MS. Chronicle quoted by Cancellieri, "havevano questi
    sei ogni anno, da Santo Spirito, due vacche in die S. Spiritus
    le quali se magnavano li con gran festa". In 1410 the <i>Volto
    Santo</i> was carried back to S. Peter's, where it has ever
    since remained<a id="footnotetag108"

    <p class="side">Reflections.</p>

    <p>The Council of Trent, in the 25th Session, teaches that
    veneration and honour are due to relics of the Saints, and that
    they and other sacred monuments are honoured by the faithful
    not without utility. We all honour the memorials of the great,
    of the wise and of the brave; who has not venerated the oak of
    a Tasso or the house of a Shakespeare? While <i>We</i> revere
    the relics of a Borromeo at Milan, of a Francois de Sales at
    Annecy, of a Luigi Gonzaga, a Filippo Neri, a Camillo de Lellis
    at Rome, others respect the chair and table of Wickliffe at
    Lutterworth, or the room of Luther at Eisenach. If infidels
    unite in paying homage to the house of the impious
    <i>philosopher</i> of Ferney, let all Christians, however they
    may be otherwise unhappily divided, join in shewing their
    respect for the image of their Saviour, and for those
    instruments which touched his sacred body, and were sanctified
    by his precious blood. O let them gaze with reverential awe on
    that lance which entering into his adorable side drew from it
    blood and water, and on that cross to which he was nailed and
    on which he died for our salvation. The early Christians, our
    forefathers in the faith, manifested great respect for the
    bodies and the blood of the martyrs, because they were faithful
    <i>followers</i> of Christ. Thus, in the letter of the faithful
    of Smyrna preserved by Eusebius, they mention that they
    gathered up the bones of their bishop Polycarp, (a disciple of
    S. John the Apostle) "more precious than pearls, and more tried
    than gold, and buried them. In this place, God willing", say
    they "we shall meet and celebrate with joy and gladness the
    birthday of this martyr". SS. Praxedes and Pudentiana, and many
    other devout females used to collect the blood of the martyrs
    with sponges and cloths, as if they feared that one drop of it
    should be lost. Read the poems of
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page90"
       id="page90"></a>[pg 90]</span> Prudentius, observe the
       phials of blood<a id="footnotetag109"
       name="footnotetag109"></a><a href="#footnote109"><sup>109</sup></a>
       placed before the martyrs' tombs in the catacombs, and you
       will not doubt the truth of such
       assertions<a id="footnotetag110"

       The shadow of Peter, the handkerchiefs which had touched the
       body of Paul, could cure diseases, as the Scripture
       witnesseth; but here are the relics of a greater than Paul,
       of a greater than Peter: O then let us kneel, and love, and
       venerate them; for they were closely united to Him who is
       the author and object of our faith, the only foundation of
       our hope, the centre and the consummation of our love.</p>

    <p class="side">Recapitulation.</p>

    <p>It does not fall within my plan to speak of the devotion of
    the three hours of agony, practised on this day in many
    churches, as at the Gesù, S. Lorenzo in Damaso etc. or of that
    which is practised after the <i>Ave Maria</i> at S. Marcello,
    Caravita etc. or of the elegies recited by the Arcadian pastors
    over their Redeemer. Let us rather briefly recapitulate with
    Morcelli the principal ceremonies of the day: Station at S.
    Croce; service in the Sixtine chapel,
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page91"
       id="page91"></a>[pg 91]</span> the veneration of the Cross;
       the B. Sacrament carried thither in procession from the
       Pauline chapel, Mass of the Presanctified and Vespers. In
       the afternoon Tenebræ, and veneration of the relics at S.
       Peter's.</p>

        similar acts of piety, walking barefooted and in the dress
        of a poor woman to the churches, and there making her
        humble offerings at the altars, and distributing copious

        <p>"God our Saviour", says S. Paul (1 Tim. II, 4) "wishes
        all men to be saved, and to come to the knowledge of the
        truth". The Catholic church is animated by the same spirit
        of charity, as the admirable prayers of this day might
        alone prove. If she teaches exclusive salvation. Christ
        taught the same "He that believeth and is baptised shall be
        saved: he that believeth not shall be condemned" Mark XVI,
        26. We cannot therefore consistently accuse the church of
        want of charity, when she proclaims the general conditions
        of salvation, without at the same time charging Christ
        himself, who first taught them, with the same fault. True
        charity desires the salvation of all but she warns others
        of their danger; and does not cruelly conceal it from them
        till it is too late.</p>

        <p>It would appear, that, before Costantine abolished the
        punishment of malefactors on the cross, the Christians, who
        well knew with S. Paul that Christ crucified was to the
        Jews a stumbling-block, and to the gentiles foolishness',
        prudently abstained from representing our Saviour nailed to
        the cross, and used rather to depict a lamb with a cross
        near it, of which instances may he seen in Rork's Hierurgia
        p. 520. The first mention of the <i>crucifix</i> in the
        church is believed to occur in the poem titled <i>De
        Passione Domini</i> referred to the fourth century. That
        the use of the sign and the image of the <i>cross</i> was
        much more ancient and very prevalent among Christians will
        appear from the following facts. "At every step and
        movement" says Tertullian (in the early part of the third
        century) "whenever we come in or go out, when we dress and
        wash ourselves, at table, when lights are brought in,
        whether we are lying or sitting down; whatever we are
        doing, we mark our foreheads with the sign of the cross".
        Eusebius mentions that Constantine placed a magnificent
        cross De Vit. Const. I. 3. In the fourth century in his
        palace S. John Chrysostom in one of his eloquent homilies
        observes "Every where the symbol of the cross is present to
        us. We inscribe it very diligently on our houses, and
        walls, and doors, and brows, and thoughts". S. Basil (De
        Spirit. S. ad Amphilochium c. 27.) derives the sign of the
        cross from Apostolic tradition. That this custom
        universally prevailed among Christians might be proved from
        S. Jerome, from the historian Socrates and others, and from
        monuments of the early Christians still preserved in Egypt:
        but why travel so far? we have only lo look around us in
        the catacombs, or in the Vatican Museum and Library. The
        cross is the chosen, the beloved sign of Christians; they
        repeated it a thousand times on their lamps, on their
        rings, on their cups and sacred vessels, that they might
        have the sign of their redemption ever before their eyes,
        they kissed it at the hour of their death, and had it
        marked on their tomb, as a sign of their hope of salvation.
        No sooner had peace shone upon the church, than crosses
        were erected on high roads, and in many places of public
        resort: and would to God that those sacred ancient
        monuments, which once adorned our own country, bore public
        testimony to the faith of its inhabitants, and recalled to
        the minds of passers-by the sufferings of their Saviour,
        had not been too rudely treated in the first heat of
        religious and political frenzy! For some ancient
        representations of the cross see the learned work of Dr.
        Rock on the mass. I shall content myself with noticing an
        interesting instance, which he has not mentioned. At
        Pompeii the house of Pansa, as it is called, is one of the
        most remarkable yet excavated on account of its extent and
        regularity. Some parts of it were used as shops, and appear
        to have been let out, (as is still the custom in some
        palaces of Rome): for they have no communication with the
        body of the building. Between two parts thus separated is
        an entrance from a side street to the peristyle or open
        court surrounded by columns; and on the pier between the
        two doors is, or rather was a painting representing one of
        the guardian-serpents or tutelary deities, who were
        sometimes represented under that form, as we occasionally
        see at Pompeii, and as we learn from Virgil (lib.) V. Hence
        as we see in Titus' baths and are informed by Persius, a
        place was considered sacred, in which serpents were
        painted. Indeed these reptiles became such favourites,
        that, according to Seneca, they used to creep upon the
        tables amid the cups: and some ladies so far overcame
        natural prejudices, as to place real serpents, if not boas,
        round their necks, to cool them, instead of using
        artificial boas to warm themselves. "Si gelidum nectit
        collo Glacilla draconem" says Martial. Before the serpent
        painted in Pansa's house is or was a projecting brick
        intended to support a lamp: the painting in consequence of
        its situation could be seen only by persons within the
        house: but upon the opposite wall there is or was a cross
        worked in bas relief upon a panel of white stucco, so
        situated as to be visible to all persons passing. It had
        the form of a Latin cross, which, we may observe, as well
        as the Greek cross: is found upon ancient Christian
        monuments; though of course we cannot bring forward other
        instances so ancient as the monument in question. (See Rock
        p. 516). "It is hard to conceive", says the learned Mazois,
        "that the same man should bow at once before the cross of
        Christ, and pay homage to Janus, Ferculus, Limetinus,
        Cardia, the deities of the threshold, and the hinges of
        doors. Perhaps at this time the cross was of a meaning
        unknown except to those who had embraced the Christian
        faith, which, placed here among the symbols of paganism, as
        if in testimony of gratitude, informed the faithful, that
        the truth had here found an asylum with a poor man, under
        the safeguard of all the popular superstitions". So far
        Mazois, whose opinion is embraced by the author of the
        interesting work on Pompeii published by the society for
        promoting useful knowledge: but is it not probable, I may
        ask, or rather is it not certain that, at that early
        period, while some members of the same family were pagans,
        others were Christians? it is not then surprising if in the
        same house we find both Christian and Pagan emblems: we may
        suppose, that some such persons may have been inmates of
        the same house as Mr. Bulwer's pagan gladiator Lydon and
        his Christian father Medon. Pompeii was overwhelmed by
        ashes in the year of Christ 79: and if Vesuvius still
        occasionally lay waste the surrounding country, we are
        indebted to it for the preservation not only of a thousand
        classical monuments, but also of a representation of the
        cross of Christ, which cannot be of a much later date than
        the time of the destruction of Jerusalem.</p>

        <p>St. Helen discovered the cross on which Christ suffered,
        and erected a church in Jerusalem, in which it was
        deposited. "The bishop of that city every year, at the
        season of the paschal solemnity, exhibits it to be
        <i>adored</i> by the people, after he himself has first
        performed his act of profound veneration". S. Paulinus of
        Nola, A.D. 430, ep. 11 ad Sever. "In the middle of Lent,
        the life-giving wood of the venerable cross is usually
        exposed for <i>adoration</i>". S. Sophronius patriarch of
        Jerusalem in 639. (Orat. in Exalt. Crucis). From this
        custom of the church of Jerusalem probably arose that of
        the Roman church, in which a crucifix, containing a
        particle of the true cross, was publicly venerated on good
        Friday. In the Sacramentary of pope Gelasius (A.D. 402) we
        read in an account of the ceremonies of this day "The
        priest comes before the altar, adoring the Lord's cross and
        kissing it&mdash;all adore the holy cross and communicate".
        This ceremony is mentioned also in the Antiphonary of S.
        Gregory the great and the ancient <i>Ordo Romanus</i>.
        Flecte genu, lignumque crucis venerabile adora, says
        Lactantius. See bishop Poynter's Christianity p. 151. Of
        the Greeks Leo Allatius relates that "on good-friday, while
        they accompany as it were Christ himself to the tomb, they
        lead round through the cities and <i>adore</i> the
        sculptured body of Christ". De consensu utriusque Eccl.
        lib. 5. c. 15. The Syrians also practise this ceremony, as
        we learn from documents published by Card. Borgia and
        Nairon. This rite is called the <i>adoration</i> of the
        cross. Let us not forget what is said in the Book of Common
        Prayer in the solemnization of Matrimony "With this ring I
        thee wed; with my body I thee <i>worship</i>". Such words
        of doubtful signification must be interpreted from the
        doctrine of the church which adopts them. Hanc veniam
        petimusque damusque vicissim. Now the word <i>adorare</i>
        used in our liturgy (derived from <i>ad</i> and <i>ora</i>,
        because persons when <i>adoring</i> used to put their right
        hand to their mouth; Plin. I. 28, c. 2. Apuleius in
        Apolog.) signifies not only to pay divine worship, but also
        to venerate and even to salute. Thus from the instances
        collected in Forcellini's Lexicon we may select the
        following: "Primo autem septimum Germanici consulatum
        adoravi". Stat in præf i. 4 Silv. Imo cum gemitu populum
        sic adorat: Apulei. lib 2. Metam. The doctrine of the
        catholic church on this subject is as usual clear and
        decided. The twenty-fifth session of the Council of Trent
        decreed as follows: "The holy synod commands all bishops,
        and others sustaining the duty and care of teaching, that
        they should diligently instruct the faithful concerning the
        legitimate use of images according to the custom of the
        catholic and apostolic church received from the
        commencement of christianity, and the consent of the holy
        fathers, and decrees of the sacred councils, teaching them
        ... that the images of Christ; of the Virgin mother of God,
        and other saints, are to be had and retained especially in
        churches, and that due honour and veneration are to be
        given them: not that any divinity or virtue is believed to
        exist in them for which they are to be worshipped, or that
        any thing is to be asked from them, or that confidence is
        to be placed in images, as was formerly done by the
        Gentiles, who used to place their hope in idol; but because
        the honour which is given to them is referred to the
        prototypes which they represent; so that by the images
        which we kiss, and before which we uncover our heads and
        bow our bodies, we adore Christ, and venerate the Saints,
        whose likeness they bear: this has been decreed against the
        opposers of images by the decrees of councils, especially
        of the second synod of Nice. And let the bishops diligently
        teach, that by the histories of the mysteries of our
        redemption expressed in pictures or other likenesses the
        people are instructed and confirmed in commemorating and
        assiduously venerating articles of faith, and that from all
        sacred images a great fruit is derived, not only because
        the people are admonished of the benefits and gifts
        conferred on them by Christ, but also because God's
        miracles through the saints, and salutary examples are laid
        before the eyes of the faithful, that they may return
        thanks for them to God, and may compose their life and
        manners to an imitation of the saints, and may be excited
        to adore and love God and cherish piety". The council then
        gives directions for the extirpation of any abuses which
        may creep in. These words, by which our faith and practice
        are regulated, are too clear to need comment, and
        sufficiently justify catholics from the foolish and
        calumnious charge of idolatry. The true Catholic practice
        is well expressed in a work attributed to Alcuin "We
        prostrate our bodies before the cross, and our souls before
        the Lord: we venerate the cross by which we have been
        redeemed, and we supplicate Him who redeemed us".</p>

        <p>Baini observes, that the chant of this hymn is one of
        the few instances of <i>rhythmical</i> chant preserved by
        uninterrupted <i>tradition</i> in the papal chapel and
        adorned with the ancient ornaments. (See his Saggio sopra
        l'indentità dei ritmi musicale e poetico. Firenze, 1820).
        "The chant of that hymn" says Eximano (quoted by Baini,
        Mem. Stor.) is a true plain chant, that is, a chant of
        unison, such as it is found in all choral books: but the
        mode of singing it in the pontifical chapel makes it appear
        different from what is sung in other churches&mdash;Above
        all, the distribution of the notes, which are sung (not of
        those which are written) adapted to express the length and
        shortness of the syllables which compose the rhythm of the
        hymn, ought to be studied. "Se si dà quell'inno ad un
        maestro di cappella per metterlo in musica concertata ed in
        <i>battuta sensibile</i>, verrà subito distrutto il
        <i>ritmo</i>, e se la cantilena della cappella pontif. si
        scrive in battuta, si vedranno cadere nel <i>battere</i>

        quantità". Dubbio di D. Antonio Eximeno sopra il saggio

        Arimathea: "for we, sacrificing the bread of proposition on
        the linen cloth, without doubt find like him the body of

        <p>In the fourth century Pope Innocent I in his epistle to
        Decentius assigns as a reason, why the holy sacrifice is
        not offered up on this day, the example of the apostles
        who, concealing themselves for fear of the Jews, spent this
        and the following day in fasting and mourning for the death
        of their master, and were thus debarred from the holy
        mysteries. During the whole of Lent the Greek church still
        celebrates, towards evening, only the mass of the
        presanctified, except on Saturdays and Sundays, and on the
        feast of the Annunciation, when the ordinary mass is
        offered up. This is one of the ancient instances of
        communion under one kind; for, as Leo Allatius observes,
        either it is received under the form of bread alone, or if
        some drops of the sacred blood were sprinkled on the host,
        all the species of wine have disappeared before communion.
        (De utriusque Ecclesiæ consensione, p. 875). Neither in the
        Latin or the Greek church is the mass of the pre-sanctified
        a <i>Missa sicca</i> or dry mass: in which not only the
        consecration, but also the communion, and all those prayers
        which are said over the holy Eucharist, used to be omitted.
        See Durandus in Rationali c. 1. This is the only day in the
        year on which mass is not offered up in the Latin church,
        and even on it the priest communicates: on holy Saturday
        mass is said, but the priest alone communicates: on all
        other days all the faithful may and many do communicate,
        either during mass or before or after it according to
        circumstances. Palmer having quoted a passage from Bona, in
        which the Cardinal regrets that communion, as well as other
        rites to which the mass is not essential, is often delayed
        till after the mass is ended, subjoins the following
        ejaculation. "Would that they who communicate with the
        Roman church were not too timid or too lukewarm to return
        to the practice of the primitive church in this and many
        other respects". Orig. Liturg. vol. 2, p. 154. Now in the
        primitive church the faithful, and even those in health,
        used to communicate not only during mass, but also at other
        times, as is evident from the office of the presanctified,
        at which, according to the Gelasian sacramentary, all
        present communicated, as well as from the numerous ancient
        instances of communion under one kind mentioned in the
        preceding chapter; for in these cases it was not received
        during the mass, and many of them are cases of "<i>persons
        in health</i>". In the same page Mr. Palmer observes that
        "<i>during all the primitive ages</i> the whole body of the
        faithful communicated at each celebration of the liturgy".
        Now has the church of England preserved this "practice of
        the primitive church"? So far is this from being the case,
        that Palmer considers her <i>ordinary</i> office as a
        "<i>Missa sicca</i>; or dry service" p. 164, in which there
        is neither consecration or communion, and the earliest
        notice of which occurs in the writings of Petrus Cantor
        (A.D. 1200), according to Palmer's own admission, ibid.
        Even on those few days in the year when she admits her
        children to communion, her ministers generally consider
        that they make an oblation only of bread and wine, and not
        of the body and blood of Christ, whereas, whatever Palmer
        or the Tracts for the Times may say to the contrary, we are
        prepared to prove from the <i>very liturgies</i>, which the
        former cites, that in the mass there is an oblation not
        merely of bread and wine but also of the body and blood of
        Christ; and accordingly even the author of Tract 81, vol.
        4, admits, p. 61, that "the real point of difference
        between the primitive church and modern views is whether
        there be in this oblation a <i>mystery</i> or no". It is
        truly lamentable that men of learning should falsely accuse
        the Roman church of departure from primitive discipline in
        a matter of so little comparative importance as the precise
        <i>time</i> when communion is to be received, while they
        themselves must acknowledge, that they have <i>abolished
        communion</i> itself as well as <i>consecration</i> on
        <i>nearly</i> all the days of the year, and that they have
        reduced the oblation of the mass from a '<i>mystery</i>'
        and a '<i>venerable, tremendous</i> and unbloody sacrifice'
        (Palmer vol. 2, p. 84) to an offering of bread and wine.
        They have thus deprived their followers of the inestimable
        fruits of communion enumerated by Christ in the
        gospel&mdash;yet these forsooth are the men who charge
        Catholics with a departure from primitive practice. How
        many other <i>primitive practices</i> mentioned in this
        work have been abolished by the church of England!</p>

        <p>The opinion of Röstell (Beschreibung der Stadt Rom, B.
        I, p. 400) that these phials contained the blessed
        eucharist under the form of wine, if admitted, would form a
        new proof of the real and permanent presence of Christ's
        blood in the B. Sacrament; yet it is a novel, unsupported,
        and untenable conjecture. Some of the ancient Christian
        Fathers complain, it is true, of the abuse of burying the
        eucharist with the deceased under the form of bread; but
        the phials of blood have been found with so many bodies,
        that we cannot reasonably suppose the custom to have been
        an abuse: and who among the ancients mentions that the
        eucharist was ever buried with them under the form of
        <i>wine</i>? That the palm-branch or crown accompanied by
        these phials of blood are authentic signs of martyrdom, see

    <p class="side">Service of Easter-eve.</p>

    <p>I remarked in the last chapter, that anciently mass was not
    said either on good-friday, or holy-saturday, and I quoted Pope
    Innocent I, who assigns as a reason the example of the
    Apostles, who spent those days in mourning for their Master. It
    was formerly customary to celebrate mass on the night of
    Easter-eve or holy Saturday. Hence when Tertullian, the oldest
    Latin Christian writer, endeavoured to dissuade his wife from
    ever marrying a <span class="pagenum"><a name="page93"
       id="page93"></a>[pg 93]</span> pagan, in case of his own
       death, among other arguments he used the following; "Who
       will tranquilly wait for you, when you are spending the
       night at the paschal solemnities?" S. Jerome also (in cap.
       25 Matt.) says, that according to apostolic tradition, the
       people did not leave the church on Easter-eve before
       midnight. This custom continued for many ages; but Hugh of
       S. Victor in the twelfth century says, that in his time, in
       order to avoid weakness arising from long fasting, the hour
       anciently observed was anticipated. The service, which is
       now performed before noon on holy Saturday, was formerly
       assigned to the night of Easter-eve: and this anticipation
       accounts for the occasional mention of night, which it
       contains, as well as for the early celebration of Christ's
       resurrection.</p>

    <p class="side">Ceremonies of holy saturday.</p>

    <p>The ceremonies of holy saturday-morning may be arranged
    under three heads: 1st. the blessing of the fire and of the
    paschal candle: 2nd. the preparation for, and ceremonies of,
    baptism: 3rd. the litany and mass. All three allude, as we
    shall see, to the resurrection of Christ, which is the great
    object of our devotion on this day. In Rome two sanctuaries are
    the great centres of attraction in the morning, viz. S. John
    Lateran's on account of the baptism of adults, and the Sixtine
    chapel, where the service is always beautiful, and particularly
    on this day. We shall first give an account of the ceremonies
    observed in the latter, and shall then describe the additional
    interesting rites of S. John Lateran's.</p>

    <p class="side">Sixtine chapel: 1. Blessing of fire and
    incense.</p>

    <p>1. As the missal prescribes, the altar is covered at a
    convenient hour, and the candles of the altar are not lighted
    till the beginning of the mass. A light, from which the
    charcoal for the incense is enkindled, is struck from a flint
    in the sacristy; where also <i>M. Sagrista</i> privately
    blesses water. The cardinals enter the Sixtine chapel vested in
    their purple <i>cappe</i>: the maces are reversed, as on
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page94"
       id="page94"></a>[pg 94]</span> friday. Meantime in the
       sacristy the Card. Celebrant wearing a purple cope and
       mitre, and assisted by the sacred ministers, blesses (as
       usually with holy water and incense) the fire and the five
       grains of incense, which are to be fixed in the paschal
       candle<a id="footnotetag111"
       name="footnotetag111"></a><a href="#footnote111"><sup>111</sup></a>.</p>

    <p class="side">Procession: Paschal candle.</p>

    <p>The Cardinal afterwards changes his cope for a chasuble,
    which is purple as well as that of the subdeacon; but
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page95"
       id="page95"></a>[pg 95]</span> the deacon, as he is going to
       bless the Paschal candle<a id="footnotetag112"
       name="footnotetag112"></a><a href="#footnote112"><sup>112</sup></a>,
       wears a white dalmatic. They then enter the Sixtine chapel;
       where, having put incense into the thurible, the
       <span class="pagenum"><a name="page96"
       id="page96"></a>[pg 96]</span> Cardinal remains: but the
       deacon, the subdeacon who carries the cross, and the other
       ministers go to the Pauline chapel, whence a procession
       returns in the following order. After two mace bearers comes
       an acolythe with the five grains of incense, and another
       with the thurible; then the subdeacon carrying the cross;
       and the deacon with a reed, at the top of which are 3
       candles united together. At his left hand is a Master of
       ceremonies with a small candle lighted from the blessed
       fire, and he is followed by two other acolythes. When the
       deacon arrives near the door of the <i>cancellata</i>, one
       of the three candles is lighted, and all genuflect, except
       the subdeacon: the deacon then sings, <i>Lumen Christi</i>,
       the light of Christ, and the choir answers, Thanks be to
       God. The other two candles are lighted in turn, as the
       Deacon approaches nearer to the altar; singing the same
       words each time, but gradually in a higher tone. He then
       gives the reed to an acolythe; and before he sings the
       <i>exultet</i> or blessing of the Paschal candle, he
       receives the benediction of the Card. Celebrant, who once
       more puts incense into the
       thurible.</p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page97"
       id="page97"></a>[pg 97]</span>

    <p class="side">Deacon sings the <i>Exultet</i>:</p>

    <p class="side">triple candle</p>

    <p>The deacon<a id="footnotetag113"
       name="footnotetag113"></a><a href="#footnote113"><sup>113</sup></a>
       goes to the book, and has the subdeacon on his right hand,
       and on his left the thurifer and two acolythes, one of whom
       holds the reed, and the other the plate containing the five
       grains of incense. All stand, as at the gospel: he incenses
       the book, and then sings the
       <i>Exultet</i><a id="footnotetag114"
       name="footnotetag114"></a><a href="#footnote114"><sup>114</sup></a>.
       After the words <i>curvat imperia</i>, he fixes
       <span class="pagenum"><a name="page98"
       id="page98"></a>[pg 98]</span> in the candle the five grains
       of incense in the form of a cross<a id="footnotetag115"
       name="footnotetag115"></a><a href="#footnote115"><sup>115</sup></a>.
       At the words "<i>ignis accendit</i>" he lights the paschal
       candle with one of the <i>three</i>
       lights<a id="footnotetag116"
       name="footnotetag116"></a><a href="#footnote116"><sup>116</sup></a>.
       When the blessing, as it is called, is ended, the paschal
       candle is left lighted near the pulpit and the seats of the
       Card. deacons, and the triple candle is placed near the
       altar on the gospel-side<a id="footnotetag117"
       name="footnotetag117"></a><a href="#footnote117"><sup>117</sup></a>.
       The deacon then takes off his white vestments, puts on
       others of a purple colour, and joins the Card, celebrant,
       who accompanied by the ministers takes his seat on
       <i>Faldistorio</i> near the altar on the epistle-side, to
       hear the prophecies recited.</p>

    <p class="side">2. Baptism administered.</p>

    <p class="side">communion of children.</p>

    <p>2. The administration of the Sacrament of Baptism forms an
    important feature in the ceremonies of this day: indeed
    anciently it was customary to confer it only on holy-saturday,
    and the eve of Whit-sunday, except in case of
    necessity<a id="footnotetag118"
       name="footnotetag118"></a><a href="#footnote118"><sup>118</sup></a>.
       On these two days those Catechumens who
       <span class="pagenum"><a name="page99"
       id="page99"></a>[pg 99]</span> were sufficiently instructed,
       and also children, used to be baptised<a id="footnotetag119"
       name="footnotetag119"></a><a href="#footnote119"><sup>119</sup></a>
       by the bishop, and by the bishop of Rome as well as
       others<a id="footnotetag120"
       name="footnotetag120"></a><a href="#footnote120"><sup>120</sup></a>;
       and after they had been baptised, they all received
       Confirmation and the holy Eucharist<a id="footnotetag121"
       name="footnotetag121"></a><a href="#footnote121"><sup>121</sup></a>.</p>

    <p class="side">Prophecies.</p>

    <p>The twelve lessons or prophecies read on this day were
    intended for the instruction of the catechumens; and they are
    well selected for that purpose, as they contain an account of
    the creating, the flood, the obedience of Abraham, the
    deliverance of God's people from their enemies at the red sea,
    the precept concerning the paschal
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page100"
       id="page100"></a>[pg 100]</span> lamb, the conversion of
       Ninive, the refusal of the three children to adore
       Nabuchodonosor's statue, etc. they are twelve in the ancient
       Gelasian Ordo. They are sung in the Sixtine chapel by
       members of the papal choir, and are read by the Card.
       celebrant. After each prophecy the Cardinal standing up
       sings a prayer: the deacon chants <i>Flectamus genua</i> and
       the subdeacon <i>Levate</i> before each, except the last,
       when the knee is not bent, in order to shew abhorence of the
       idolatry exacted by Nabuchodonosor for his statue. After the
       4th, 8th, and 11th prophecies an appropriate Tract is sung
       by the choir. Formerly some or all of these prophecies were
       said in Greek as well as in Latin. (See Cancellieri,
       <i>Funz. d. Set. S.</i> § 4, Martene T. 3. p. 148.). These
       lesson are recited even where there is no baptismal font, as
       at the Sixtine chapel. After them follow in S. John
       Lateran's and other churches the blessing of the font, and
       in some of them administration of baptism.</p>

    <p class="side">3. The litany: invocation of Saints.</p>

    <p class="side">Change from mourning to rejoicing.</p>

    <p>3. In the papal chapel, immediately after the prophecies,
    the Celebrant takes off his chasuble, and prostrates himself
    with the sacred ministers before the altar; all the others also
    kneel, and two tenor voices from the choir chant in the middle
    of the chapel the greater litanies, called those of the saints,
    each petition of which is repeated in the same words by the
    choir<a id="footnotetag122"
       name="footnotetag122"></a><a href="#footnote122"><sup>122</sup></a>.
       Before the <span class="pagenum"><a name="page101"
       id="page101"></a>[pg 101]</span> verse "<i>Peccatores te
       rogamus audi nos</i>" the assistant priest and ministers go
       to the sacristy, and put on white vestments. Then returning
       to the chapel they assist the Card. Celebrant to put on his
       white vestments at his <i>faldistorio</i>.
       <span class="pagenum"><a name="page102"
       id="page102"></a>[pg 102]</span> The candles are now lighted
       (at the <i>Agnus Dei</i> of the litany, as the Sacramentary
       of S. Gregory and the Ordo Romanus prescribe); the purple
       veil which covered the throne and the purple <i>paliotto</i>
       or facing of the altar are
       <span class="pagenum"><a name="page103"
       id="page103"></a>[pg 103]</span> removed; and both appear
       decked in white. The Cardinals assisted by theirs
       <i>caudatarii</i> take off their purple <i>cappe</i>, and
       put on others of scarlet brought in by their respective
       <i>camerieri</i>. The reason of this sudden change from
       mourning to rejoicing we have already seen: the celebration
       of Christ's resurrection from the dead is celebrated by
       anticipation.</p>

    <p class="side">High mass.</p>

    <p>At the end of the litanies, the Pope (if His Holiness were
    not present at the preceding ceremonies) enters the chapel,
    wearing a white cope and a mitre; at the foot of the altar he
    repeals as usual the beginning of the mass with the Card.
    Celebrant at His left hand: in the meantime the choir sings
    solemnly the <i>Kyrie eleison</i> etc. (as there is no
    <i>Introit</i> of the Mass, because the people were assembled
    in the church previously): the Pope goes to His throne, and
    receives the usual <i>ubbidienza</i>; and the other customary
    ceremonies of high mass in the papal chapel take place (see p.
    19 and foll.) with such exceptions as we shall now mention. As
    soon as the Celebrant commences the <i>Gloria in excelsis</i>,
    the veil is removed from the tapestry over the altar; which
    represents Christ rising from the dead<a id="footnotetag123"
       name="footnotetag123"></a><a href="#footnote123"><sup>123</sup></a>,
       the cannons of S. Angelo are discharged, the
       <span class="pagenum"><a name="page104"
       id="page104"></a>[pg 104]</span> arms are no longer reversed
       and the bells of the city are tolled, to announce to its
       faithful inhabitants the resurrection of their Divine
       Lord.</p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page105"
       id="page105"></a>[pg 105]</span>

    <p class="side">Alleluja.</p>

    <p>After the epistle, sung as usual by the subdeacon, another
    subdeacon (<i>Uditore di Rota</i>) wearing a white
    <i>tonacella</i> or tunic announces at the foot of the throne
    the joyful tidings to His Holiness<a id="footnotetag124"
       name="footnotetag124"></a><a href="#footnote124"><sup>124</sup></a>
       by chanting aloud; "<i>Pater sancte, annuntio vobis gaudium
       magnum, quod est, Alleluja</i>": having then kissed the
       Pope's foot he returns into the sacristy. This word of
       joy<a id="footnotetag125"
       name="footnotetag125"></a><a href="#footnote125"><sup>125</sup></a>
       <i>Alleluja</i>, (praise God) which had not been once
       uttered during the long season of mourning which preceded
       this solemnity, is now sung thrice by the Celebrant,
       gradually raising his voice to a higher tone. The choir
       reechoes it each time, singing it in <i>contrapunto</i>, and
       then chants the verse <i>Confitemini</i>, and the tract,
       which is ordinarily recited in penitential times. Throughout
       the mass the joy of the church is incomplete; for though
       Christ has risen from the dead, He has not yet appeared to
       His disciples, and the light of faith is still overclouded,
       as Alcuin remarks: hence lights are not carried at the
       gospel; the Creed, offertory, motetto and <i>Agnus</i>
       <span class="pagenum"><a name="page106"
       id="page106"></a>[pg 106]</span> <i>Dei</i> are omitted, and
       the kiss of peace is not given<a id="footnotetag126"
       name="footnotetag126"></a><a href="#footnote126"><sup>126</sup></a>.
       Merati adds to the cause already assigned the wish to
       abridge service; particularly on account of the
       newly-baptised children, who communicated at this mass; and
       the unusual shortness of the Vespers confirms this
       opinion.</p>

    <p class="side">End of the mass.</p>

    <p>After the Celebrant has communicated, Vespers are sung by
    the choir, in place of the <i>communion</i> and postcommunion.
    They consist of the anthem <i>Alleluja</i> repeated three times
    before and after the short psalm <i>Laudate Dominion omnes
    gentes</i> etc.; of the anthem <i>Vesper autem sabbati</i>,
    which the Celebrant commences and the choir continues; of the
    <i>Magnificat</i><a id="footnotetag127"
       name="footnotetag127"></a><a href="#footnote127"><sup>127</sup></a>
       and in fine of the prayer which is chanted by the Card.
       Celebrant. While the anthem before the <i>Magnificat</i> is
       sung, the Pope puts incense into the thurible; the celebrant
       incenses the crucifix and the altar, and is incensed by the
       deacon, and the incensing continues as after the offertory
       at high-mass (See p. 21) At the <i>Gloria Patri</i> the
       deacon, having incensed the Card, priests,
       <span class="pagenum"><a name="page107"
       id="page107"></a>[pg 107]</span> bows his head in the middle
       of the chapel, and then proceeds to incense the Card,
       deacons. After the prayer; <i>Ite Missa est, Alleluja,
       Alleluja</i>, is sung; and the choir answers, <i>Deo gratias
       Alleluja, Alleluja</i>: the Pope gives the usual blessing,
       the Celebrant publishes the indulgence of thirty years and
       this beautiful service terminates. In the sacristy His
       Holiness puts on a <i>mozzetta</i> of white (instead of red)
       damask, and wears it during the whole of Easter week: His
       shoes also are white. The Cardinals put on red
       <i>mantellette</i> and <i>mozzette</i> over their purple
       cassocks; these they afterwards change for others of
       scarlet.</p>

    <p class="side">Mass of Pope Marcellus.</p>

    <p>The mass sung on this day is that of Pierluigi da
    Palestrina, called the mass of Pope Marcellus; not because it
    was composed during his pontificate; but because, according to
    Baini, Pierluigi had intended to dedicate a work to that Pope,
    to whom he was grateful and attached, but was disappointed by
    His Holiness' premature death; and therefore he persuaded Card.
    Vitellozzi to give it that name in honour of his former patron.
    This is the celebrated mass, which rescued ecclesiastical music
    from the dangers which surrounded it in the Pontificate of Pius
    IV (as we have related in The Papal Chapel, Rome, 1839), and
    not of Marcellus II, as Baini has proved. It is said, that when
    it was first sung in the papal chapel, the Card. dean Francesco
    Pisani was so enraptured with it, that he exclaimed with Dante,
    Paradise, Canto X.</p>

       the fountains of water, etc. is sung<a id="footnotetag131"
       name="footnotetag131"></a><a href="#footnote131"><sup>131</sup></a>.
       His Em. then chants the prayers appointed for the
       benediction of the font; he divides the water with his hand
       in the form of a cross, exorcises it, touches it, signs it
       three times with the sign of our redemption, and pours some
       of it towards the four parts of the world, in allusion to
       the command of Christ: "<i>Go teach all nations, baptising
       them</i>" (Matt. XXVIII). He then dips the paschal candle
       three times into the water, singing, and each time raising
       his voice to a higher pitch than before: "May the power of
       the Holy Ghost descend upon the fulness of this font"; as
       when He descended, says Gavant, "in the form of a dove at
       the baptism of Christ represented by this candle plunged
       into the water". Then breathing three times on the water
       nearly in the form of a cross "that he may unite the Trinity
       with the cross" (as the same author observes) he continues
       the chant, and raises the candle from the water, alluding in
       the prayer to "the effect of baptism, which confers grace,
       <i>raising</i> the soul from sin to glory". (Gavant). The
       blessed water is then sprinkled upon the people, and some of
       it is reserved to be sprinkled in houses, etc. In order to
       sanctify the water still more, the Cardinal now pours into
       it, in the form of a cross, oil of catechumens and chrism;
       and mixes them with the water of the font, in the name of
       the Father, Son, and <span class="pagenum"><a name="page110"
       id="page110"></a>[pg 110]</span> Holy Ghost. This last
       ceremony is intended to signify, according to mystical
       interpreters, such as Amalarius, Honorius, Durandus, etc.
       "the union of Christ by baptism with the members of the
       church" (Gavant). The prayers of this benediction, most of
       which are sung in the tone of the <i>preface</i> at ferial
       mass, contain beautiful allusions to the mention of water in
       the Old and New Testaments, as for instance: "O God, whose
       Spirit at the very beginning of the world was borne upon the
       waters, that the nature of water might even then conceive
       the power of sanctification; O God, who washing with waters
       the crimes of a guilty world, didst sign the figure of
       regeneration in the very out-pouring of the deluge; may this
       font receive of the Holy Ghost the grace of thy only
       begotten Son"<a id="footnotetag132"

    <p class="side">Baptism of adults.</p>

    <p>The Cæremoniale Episcoporum prescribes that infants, except
    in danger of death, should not be baptised during the eight
    preceding days, that they may be reserved for holy-Saturday.
    The beginning of the baptismal service and the exorcisms are
    performed privately in the sacristy by the parish-priest, while
    the prophecies are read in church<a id="footnotetag133"

       blessed, the catechumens wearing a long white dress, and
       accompanied by their respective godfathers and godmothers,
       approach the font, and in turn ascend. In answer to the
       questions of the Cardinal (who is now vested in a white, and
       not a purple, cope,) having renounced Satan and all his
       works and pomps, they profess their belief in the articles
       of Christian faith, and their desire of

    <p class="side">Litanies and confirmation.</p>

    <p>The litanies are sung, while the procession returns to the
    church, where the newly-baptised are confirmed in a
    side-chapel, and exhorted to perseverance in virtue, by the
    Cardinal<a id="footnotetag135"
       name="footnotetag135"></a><a href="#footnote135"><sup>135</sup></a>;
       the litanies are then continued, but cease while all
       kneeling venerate the heads of SS. Peter and Paul shewn from
       above the high altar; the procession afterwards returns to
       the tribune, where the mass of the day is sung, and orders
       are conferred by the Cardinal-Vicar.</p>

    <p class="side">Mass and ordination.</p>

    <p>The orders of priests and deacons are often mentioned in the
    N. Testament: and the church, as S. Thomas observes, instituted
    the inferior orders. Subdeacons are mentioned by Pope Cornelius
    and S. Cyprian in the 3rd century, as well as acolythes,
    exorcists, and lectors. S. Augustine and S. Gregory Nazianzen
    speak of <i>ostiarii</i>; and the clerical tonsure is mentioned
    by S. Isidore at the beginning of the 5th century, as a rite
    established before his time. Orders are conferred by the laying
    on of hands and prayer, as the scripture teaches, and also by
    the delivery of the instruments belonging to each order:
    appropriate exhortations addressed to the candidates for the
    different orders are interspersed with the prayers prescribed
    in the pontifical. (On their antiquity the reader may consult
    Morinus <span class="pagenum"><a name="page113"
       id="page113"></a>[pg 113]</span> de Ordinationibus, Martene
       de Antiquis Eccl. Ritibus, T. 2. etc.) The tonsure is given
       after the <i>Kyrie eleison</i> of the mass, the 4 minor
       orders after the <i>Gloria in excelsis</i>; subdeacons are
       ordained before the epistle, which one of them repeats;
       deacons after the epistle and finally priests after the
       first part of the tract. These last, after the imposition of
       hands, receive their peculiar vestments, viz. the stole
       hanging down in front, and the chasuble: their hands are
       anointed with oil of catechumens, and they receive a chalice
       containing wine and water, a paten with a host, and power to
       say mass. (Luke XXII, 19). After offerings of candle have
       been made to the ordaining Bishop, the new priests join him
       in saying mass<a id="footnotetag136"
       name="footnotetag136"></a><a href="#footnote136"><sup>136</sup></a>:
       and after the newly-ordained and baptised have communicated,
       the priests profess their faith by reciting the apostles'
       creed; they receive power to forgive and retain sins (John
       XX, 22, 23), they promise reverence and obedience to their
       ecclesiastical superior, and receive the bishops blessing,
       who then directs that masses and prayers be said by those
       whom he has ordained, and recommends himself to their
       prayers. In other respects the mass is similar to that of
       the Papal chapel<a id="footnotetag137"

    <p>Having spoken of the ceremonies of the Vatican and S. John
    Lateran's, we might consider our task as
    completed<a id="footnotetag138"
       name="footnotetag138"></a><a href="#footnote138"><sup>138</sup></a>.
       Yet one more <i>funzione</i> attracts our countrymen on this
       day; and we are therefore unwilling to bid them farewell,
       before it is ended. Come then to S. Biagio or to S. Gregorio
       Illuminatore, to assist at the Armenian mass; and on the
       road we may talk of the venerable and amiable Fathers who
       perform that solemn service, and of the nature of their
       liturgy.</p>

    <p>SS. Bartholomew and Thaddaeus were the first apostles of
    Armenia: but it was not till the beginning of the 4th century,
    that the whole country became Christian in consequence of the
    divine blessing, which attended the zealous exertions of S.
    Gregory surnamed the Illuminator. In the 6th century great
    numbers of the Armenians were infected with the heresy of
    Eutyches, who denied that there were two natures in Christ: and
    to this error they afterwards added some others. In the
    pontificate of John XXII, about the year 328, a zealous
    Dominican bishop, called Bartholomew of Bologna, went as a
    missionary among them; and many of the Eutychians or
    Monophysites returned to the bosom of the Catholic church. In
    the <span class="pagenum"><a name="page115"
       id="page115"></a>[pg 115]</span> 16th century the Catholics
       were so furiously persecuted by Zachary, a schismatical
       patriarch, that they fled and took refuge in other
       countries. They have at present two establishments at Rome,
       one of the Antonian monks at the church of S. Gregory
       Illuminator, behind the colonnade of S. Peter's; and a
       national <i>ospizio</i> at S. Biagio in strada Giulia.</p>

    <p class="side">their liturgy.</p>

    <p>"The Armenians," says Palmer "have only one liturgy, which
    is written in the ancient Armenian language, and has been used
    by them from time immemorial. The whole groundwork and order of
    the Armenian liturgy coincides with the Cæsarean, as used in
    the time of Basil. This liturgy has, like most others, received
    many additions in the course of ages. There are several prayers
    extracted from the liturgy of Chrysostom, and actually ascribed
    to him" Vol. 1, Liturgy of Armenia. "The liturgy of Basil can
    be traced with tolerable certainty to the 4th century. Striking
    as are some of the features, in which it differs from that of
    Antioch, it is nevertheless evidently a superstructure raised
    on that basis: the composition of both is the same, i.e. the
    parts, which they have in common, follow in the same order. The
    same may be said of the Constantinopolitan liturgy, commonly
    attributed to S. Chrysostom, of that of the Armenian church,
    and of the florid and verbose composition in use among the
    Nestorians of Mesopotamia. So that the liturgy of Antioch,
    commonly attributed to S. James, appears to be the basis of all
    the oriental liturgies". Tracts for the Times, N. 63. The
    author then proceeds to state the grounds of the belief that
    the liturgies of Antioch, Alexandria, Rome and Gaul were of
    Apostolic origin; concluding thus "It may perhaps be said
    without exaggeration, that next to the holy scriptures they
    possess the greatest claims on our veneration and study". Padre
    Avedichian observes in <span class="pagenum"><a name="page116"
       id="page116"></a>[pg 116]</span> his preface to the Armenian
       liturgy, that it was probably compiled by John
       <i>Mandagunense</i>, an Armenian patriarch of the fifth
       century.</p>

    <p class="side">Armenian high-mass.</p>

    <p>We shall now give a brief account of their high mass, which
    we do the more readily, because Mr. Palmer represents it in a
    very mutilated form. The celebrant, whether priest or bishop,
    is vested in the sacristy: the vestments bear some resemblance
    to those of the Greeks. The beginning of the mass is the only
    part probably taken from the Roman liturgy, but it contains an
    invocation of the B. Virgin and of the saint of the day. When
    the celebrant goes up to the altar, the veil is drawn: he
    uncovers the chalice, blesses the host, which is like ours of
    unleavened bread; pours wine and water into the chalice, and
    recites the beautiful prayer of S. John Chrysostom: "O Lord our
    God, who hast sent our Lord Jesus Christ the celestial bread,
    the nourishment of the whole world; do thou bless this
    proposition etc." The veil is then drawn back, and the
    offerings, the altar, and the people are incensed. The
    Celebrant recites the prayer of the festival, followed by other
    prayers composed by S. John Chrysostom: the Trisagion is sung,
    and the gospel is carried in procession, and is kissed by one
    of the congregation. Then follow the epistle, gospel, and
    creed. After two prayers, and two benedictions imparted to the
    people; the offerings are carried in procession to the altar,
    the celebrant offers them up to God, and prays that Jesus
    Christ will make him worthy to consecrate, and receive his
    "holy and immaculate body and precious blood; for thou, O
    Christ our God, art he who offers and is offered". After he has
    washed his hands, he says "O Lord God of armies, let this
    victim become "the true body and blood of thy only begotten
    Son". He then blesses the people, says prayers which correspond
    to our preface and <i>Sanctus</i>, and pronounces the words of
    consecration. After he has said
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page117"
       id="page117"></a>[pg 117]</span> other prayers, and made the
       sign of the cross several times over the host and chalice,
       he invokes the holy Ghost, begging also that the body and
       blood of Christ may produce "the salvation of our souls and
       the remission of our sins". He then prays, through the
       merits of the holy sacrifice, for the whole world, the
       church and state, all conditions of men and for all the
       faithful departed: he invokes the intercession of the B.
       Virgin and all the Saints: he prays for the Pope and all
       present; and after other similar supplications, he says the
       <i>Pater noster</i>. The elevation takes place at this part
       of the mass, and also the blessing of the people with the
       consecrated host and chalice, accompanied by appropriate
       prayers. After the curtains have been drawn, the priest
       breaks the host, and puts a particle of it into the chalice:
       he then receives communion, blesses the people with the
       chalice and particle, and distributes communion; before its
       distribution the curtains are drawn back. When the ablutions
       and prayers after the celebrant's communion are ended,
       turning towards the people, he recites a prayer of S. John
       Chrisostom, which is followed by the last gospel. Then
       invoking the holy cross he blesses the people, who unite in
       praising God. He finally blesses them again, and distributes
       blessed bread (not consecrated) among them. At S. Gregorio
       Illuminatore Vespers are added and said <i>in circolo</i>:
       the clergy carry tapers; and the gospel is held up by the
       Celebrant to implore blessings on the people.</p>

    <p class="side">Reflections.</p>

    <p>These ceremonies may appear singular to us, who are of a
    different clime and different customs; their music in
    particular is little in accordance with our taste, or notions
    of melody and harmony. Yet the remark of Montfaucon (Diario
    Italico) "æra Dodonæa dixisses", alluding to the brass kettles
    of the oracle (Potter Arch. Graec. B. 2, § 8) is an
    exaggeration. Their <i>flabelli</i> are of metal, of a round
    form, surrounded with little bells, which are sounded
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page118"
       id="page118"></a>[pg 118]</span> at the seraphic hymn, to
       express, if we might believe Cancellieri, "by the trembling
       of the hands, that of the blessed spirits, who assist at the
       throne of the Divine Majesty with fear and trembling". (Tre
       Pontific. Not. VI). Their mass is anticipated, but not at so
       early an hour as that of the Latin. (Even in the Latin
       church, permissions to say mass in the afternoon of this day
       have been granted by some Popes; they may be seen in
       Cancellieri. <i>Funz. d. Sett. S. p</i>. 183, 184). Amid the
       numerous differences between their rite and our own, the
       attentive spectator will not fail to remark the similarity
       of the substance and order of their liturgy, and of that of
       the Roman church; although, with the solitary exception of
       the beginning of the mass, both have existed independently
       of one another during the last 1400 years. This is a
       powerful argument in favour of the great antiquity, nay of
       the apostolic origin of their most important ceremonies,
       which may be traced through different channels to the
       <i>primitive</i> liturgies of Rome and Antioch. It is also
       one of those striking illustrations, which Rome presents, of
       the unity and catholicity of the church; and at the same
       time of the adaptation of her immutable doctrines and sacred
       practices to the feelings and customs of widely-separated
       nations who, having little in common but human nature, yet
       all acknowledge "one Lord, one faith, and one baptism".
       (Ephes. IV. 5); and all belong to "one fold and one
       shepherd". John X, 16.</p>

    <p class="side">Conclusion.</p>

    <p>Having now considered in detail the various ceremonies of
    Holy Week at Rome, a philosophic mind will take a general
    review of them: and this question will very naturally suggest
    itself: What judgment ought I to form concerning them? am I to
    consider them as mummery, or superstition, or idolatry, as many
    most confidently pronounce, who are unacquainted with their
    nature, their origin, and their meaning; and at the same time
    are little <span class="pagenum"><a name="page119"
       id="page119"></a>[pg 119]</span> accustomed from early
       infancy to any language or gesticulations save those of the
       tongue? or am I not rather to regard them as a solemn, and
       sacred, and pathetic, and most ancient expression of
       Christian faith and Christian feeling; which, united as it
       is with the noblest productions of divine inspiration and of
       Christian art may haply not only instruct and elevate the
       mind, but also enkindle in the soul flames of that pure and
       practical devotion, which this holy season demands from
       every follower of Christ? Let the reader decide for himself;
       but for our part, we envy not the mind or heart of him, who
       can prefer the former of these views. We shall ever bless
       God, that we have learnt in another school not to condemn
       the customs and manners of other countries and other people,
       merely because they differ from our own; and that we are
       disposed to attribute to signs the meaning attached to them
       by those who adopt them, and not that of our own fancies.
       Men of warmer climates than our own convey to others their
       sentiments and feelings by action as easily as by the
       tongue. Italians, as well as Greeks and Orientals, have
       inherited from their fathers a language of gesture more
       powerful and expressive than that of words. The Hebrew
       prophets, Isaiah, Ezechiel, and others, nay Christ himself,
       spoke by action as well by the tongue. God appointed in the
       old law innumerable ceremonies: Christ in the new law of
       spirit and truth instituted sacred rites, or sanctified
       those which previously existed: the early church imitated
       His blessed example: and they have been faithfully preserved
       as a precious inheritance till the present time. The very
       objection, that some of them were borrowed from Jews or
       Pagans, is a proof of their primitive antiquity: Christ or
       the church removed from them all profaneness or
       superstition, and then adopted and sanctified them. (See
       Wiseman's Letters to Poynder). If all parties unite in
       approbation of the illumination of the
       <span class="pagenum"><a name="page120"
       id="page120"></a>[pg 120]</span> cupola of S. Peter's, and
       of the fireworks of S. Angelo, considered as outward
       demonstrations of the exultation of the church at the
       resurrection of her Divine Spouse; we shall ever admire also
       the expressions of christian feeling exhibited in the
       interior of her temples, whether they consist in ceremonies
       or words; and on this day emulating the transports of joy of
       the fervent and eloquent pilgrim to Jerusalem and Mount
       Sinai, when shall unite our voices with those of the angelic
       spirits in singing, <i>Alleluja</i>; "because Jesus Christ,
       our Lord, who was delivered up for our sins, rose again for
       our justification". Rome. IV, 24, 25.<a id="footnotetag139"

        <p>Anciently in some churches, as Thomassin has shewn (de
        dierum Festorum celebratione lib. 2. c. 14), fire used to
        be struck from a flint to light the church-lamps etc. every
        day and particularly on Saturday, and the new fire was
        blessed; on holy Saturday however this ceremony was
        performed with great solemnity; and in the 11th century it
        was restricted to that day alone. At Rome in holy week this
        practice was not originally confined to holy Saturday, but
        was observed on the three days before caster: for the first
        <i>Ordo Romanus</i> directs, that on holy <i>thursday</i>
        fire should be struck from a flint outside the church, and
        blessed. Amalarius also (4e Ordine Antiph.) testifies that
        on good <i>friday</i> "new fire was enkindled and reserved
        till the nocturnal office". Leo IV however (A.D. 847)
        appears to have first ordered that on Easter Eve "the old
        fire should be put out, and new fire blessed and
        distributed among the people" (Homil. de cura Pastorali).
        For Pope Zachary, about the year 731. in answer to the
        enquiries of Boniface, bishop of Mayence, states that "on
        holy thursday, when the sacred chrism is consecrated, three
        lamps of a large size filled with oil collected from the
        different lamps of the church, and placed in a secret part
        of the said church, should burn there constantly, so that
        the oil may suffice till the third day, that is saturday.
        Then let the fire of the lamps which is used for the sacred
        font be renewed. But concerning the fire taken <i>ex
        cristallis</i>, as you have asserted, we have no
        tradition". Pouget (Inst. Cathol. l. 1) observes that the
        new fire is blessed with great solemnity on this day,
        "because the fire struck from a flint appears to be a type
        of Christ arising from the dead". Formerly not only the
        lights of the church, but all the fires of the city were
        enkindled from the blessed fire (as we learn from a MS.
        Sancti Victoris (ap. Martene, De ant. Eccl. Ritibus lib.
        IV, c. XXIV). "After the <i>Ite Missa est</i>" says the
        Ordinarium of Luke archbishop of Cosenza "the bishop gives
        his blessing, and immediately the deacon commands the
        people, saying "Receive the new fire from the holy candle,
        and having put out the old, light it in your houses in the
        name of Christ; then rejoicing they depart with the light".
        This custom is mentioned also in Leo IVth's homily above
        quoted.</p>

        <p>As for the Paschal candle, Anastasius says that Zosimus,
        who was elected pope in 417, gave leave that candles should
        be blessed in the churches. Bened. XIV, Merati and Gretser
        understand by these words, that that Pontiff only extended
        to the parish churches a custom already practised in the
        greater churches: however this may be, the blessing of this
        candle is at least as old as the time of Pope Zosimus. It
        is inserted in the ancient sacramentary of Pope Gelasius
        (A.D. 495). S. Augustine (lib. 15 de Civ. Dei) mentions
        some verses written by himself in praise of the paschal
        candle. S. Jerome also speaks of it in his epistles; and
        Ennodius bishop of Pavia in 519 wrote two formulas,
        according to which it might be blessed. Cancellieri, at the
        end of his <i>Funzioni della Settimana Santa</i>, describes
        two blessings of the paschal candle contained in
        manuscripts of the 12th century. Du Vert as usual rejects
        every mystical meaning of the candle: but why then should
        it be lighted on this night, and not on christmas and other
        nights? The 4th Council of Toledo, held in 633, states that
        the paschal candle is blessed, in order that we may receive
        the mystery of Christ's resurrection; and hence the abbot
        Rupert says, that the candle when lighted represents
        Christ's resurrection from the dead. That such is its
        meaning appears from the five holes made in it in the form
        of a cross, to represent the five wounds of Christ: in them
        the five grains of incense are fixed by the Deacon, in
        order to represent, according to Rupert, the spices applied
        to Christ's body by Joseph of Arimathea. In confirmation of
        this explanation, we may observe that this candle is not
        removed from the church till the gospel has been sung on
        Ascension-day when Christ departed from among men: and it
        is lighted at solemn mass before the <i>gospel</i> and at
        vespers before the <i>Magnificat</i> on the Sundays and
        holidays which occur between holy saturday and the
        ascension. To the same symbolical meaning of this candle we
        must attribute the ancient custom of affixing to it (as a
        symbol of Christ) a tablet on which the current year of our
        Lord and its indiction were marked: sometimes these, if not
        other chronological dates, were inscribed on the candle
        itself by the deacon, before he sang the <i>Exultet</i>, as
        Ven. Bede testifies, The same idea was preserved in the
        practice of forming the <i>Agnus Dei</i> with the wax of
        the paschal candle. "On this day" (holy saturday) says
        Durandus "the acolythes of the Roman church make
        <i>lambs</i> of newly blessed wax, or of the <i>wax of the
        paschal candle</i> of the preceding year mixed with chrism:
        on Saturday in Albis they are distributed by the Lord Pope
        to the people in the churches". Amalarius likewise mentions
        this custom. It appears also from the two benedictions of
        Ennodius mentioned above, that the faithful used particles
        of the pascal candle as a preservative against storms: the
        good effects hoped for in this and similar cases are
        attributed to the prayers of the church, which God in His
        goodness has promised to hear. The paschal candle is
        painted according to an ancient custom.</p>

        <p>Pierin del Vaga, whom Vasari considered as the most
        distinguished of Raffaello's assistants, was originally
        nothing more than a candlepainter. His creation of Eve at
        S. Marcello at Rome, and his frescoes in the Doria place at
        Genoa, are well-known; at the Vatican he assisted Giovanni
        d'Udine in his arabesques, Polidoro in his antique
        chiaroscuri, and executed some of the most beautiful
        historical paintings of the loggie di Raffaello. Hence may
        we judge of the versatility of his talents.</p>

        <p>Why does a deacon perform this ceremony? since other
        benedictions are reserved to bishops and priests. Rupert
        assigns as a reason, that Christ's body was wrapped in
        spices by his disciples, and not by the apostles whose
        successors are bishops and priests: besides, the hymn sung
        by the deacon is the præconium Paschale, or announcement of
        the Resurrection, which was first made by inferiors to
        their superiors, by the women to the apostles. We may add
        that both the fire and the 5 grains of incense are
        previously blessed by the priest, and in the præconium
        itself there is not any form of blessing, strictly
        speaking. In the church of Ravenna however the bishop used
        to bless this candle (S. Gregory ep. 28, lib. 9). In the
        Roman church, according to cardinal Gaetani, the last of
        the Cardinal priests usually blessed the fire, and the last
        Card. deacon lighted the <i>lumen Christi</i>, or triple
        candle, and the Paschal candle. The deacon used to bless
        the latter either at the steps of the presbytery, or from
        the ambo; and hence we find a marble column, intended to
        support it, fixed to the ambo in S. Clement's S.
        Laurence's, and S. Pancras' churches at Rome. See another
        marble column destined for the same use ap. Ciampini, Vet.
        mon. cap. 2.</p>

        <p>Martene (De antiquis Eccl. rit. lib. 4, c. 24) maintains
        that this hymn was composed by S. Augustine, and this
        opinion is adopted also by Baillet and Benedict XIV, and
        confirmed by a MS. pontifical of the church of Pavia of the
        9th century, and other documents cited by Martene, ibid: it
        was corrected by S. Jerome, if we may believe an ancient
        Pontifical of Poitiers (quoted ibid.) The <i>chant</i> of
        this beautiful hymn is very ancient. "I have seen," says
        Baini "in many manuscripts both anterior and posterior to
        the 11th century the melodies of the preface, of the
        <i>Pater noster</i>, of the <i>Exultet</i>, and of the
        <i>Gloria</i> precisely such as the modern" (T. 2, p. 92).
        In a splendid roll of the Minerva (signed D. 1. 2) of the
        9th century, are contained the <i>Exultet</i>, the solemn
        benediction of the baptismal font, and the administration
        of all the ecclesiastical orders. Nor is this the only roll
        containing the chant precisely similar to the modern.
        D'Agincourt left another to the Vatican library. See also
        MS. no. 333 of the Barberini library, of the year 1503.</p>

        incense were fixed in the paschal candle even at the time
        of Prudentius in the 4th century.</p>

        <p>In churches, at the words <i>Apis mater eduxit</i>, the
        lamps also are lighted. With regard to the triple candle,
        we may observe that on an ancient marble column preserved
        in the Piazza before the cathedral of Capua is a bas-relief
        representing the lighting of the paschal candle by means of
        a reed surmounted by 3 small candles, as the Canonico
        Natali testifies in a letter printed at Naples in 1776. The
        triple candle is mentioned in the Ordo Romanus of Card.
        Gaetano, in that of Amelius, and in a MS. Pontifical of the
        church of Apamea, ap. Martene. As Thomassin observes, "we
        light a candle divided into three in honour of the Trinity,
        considering that enlightened by Christ we know that
        recondite mystery". Gavant also gives the same explanation.
        In the Greek service the bishop gives his blessing, as
        often as he sings mass, with a triple candle. In the Latin
        church it is used only on holy Saturday.</p>

        <p>This custom is proved from the letter of Siricius Pope
        in the 4th century to Himmerius, from letters of S. Leo and
        Pope Gelasius, as well as other ancient documents (ap.
        Bened. XIV, Institut. prima ed lat.); and vestiges of it
        are preserved in the liturgy of the weeks of Easter and
        Pentecost. Ordinations were generally conferred before
        Christmas, as is evident from the lives of the early Popes.
        Baptism was administered before the great festivals of
        Easter and Pentecost, that the newly-baptised might be
        prepared to celebrate them worthily, and receive the graces
        therein commemorated. Perhaps another reason for selecting
        the eve of Easter may be found in the parallel drawn by S.
        Paul between baptism and Christ's death and resurrection
        (Rom. VI, 5 and foll.): "we who are baptised in Christ
        Jesus are baptised in his death. For we are buried together
        with him by baptism unto death: that as Christ is risen
        from the dead by the glory of the Father, so we also may
        walk in newness of life" etc.</p>

        <p>According to the Ordo Romanus, children after baptism on
        this day were to take no food or milk before Communion "and
        on all days of Easter-week let them go to Mass, and let
        their parents offer for them, and let all communicate". As
        Cabassutius proves in his notitia Ecclesiastica sæculi
        primi, they used to receive the B. Sacrament under the form
        of wine alone. The bishop dipped his finger into the sacred
        blood, and then put it into the mouth of the child a
        practice observed in modern times in some parts of the
        East, according to the learned Maronite Abraham
        Ecchellensis; afterwards a little milk and honey was put
        into their mouths, as an emblem (according to John the
        deacon) of the promised land, to which they were called.
        This custom of giving communion to children was not of
        necessity for salvation, as Cardinal Noris proves in
        Vindiciis Augustinianis § 4, and the Council of Trent
        observes. In some places an abuse crept in of putting the
        milk and honey into the consecrated chalice, but it was
        prohibited by an African Council.</p>

        <p>In the 4th century, S. Basil writing to the clergy of
        Neocesarea observes, that the litanies, which they then
        used, were introduced after the time of S. Gregory
        Thaumaturgus (Epist. 63). In Gaul about the year 452, S.
        Mamertus bishop of Vienne appointed solemn litanies to be
        recited on the three <i>rogation</i> days. "At Rome," say
        Palmer, "no doubt litanies were in use at an early period,
        since we find that in the time of Gregory the great (A.D.
        590), the appellation of litany had been so long given to
        processional supplications, that it was then familiarly
        applied to those persons who formed the procession". Vol.
        1, p. 271. That holy Pontiff gave the following directions;
        "Let the litany of the clergy set out from the church of S.
        John the Baptist, the litany of the men from the church of
        the holy martyr Marcellus, the litany of the monks from the
        church of SS John and Paul: the litany of the handmaids of
        God from the church of the blessed martyrs Cosmas and
        Damian, the litany of the married women from the church of
        the blessed protomartyr Stephen; the litany of the widows
        from the church of the blessed martyr Vitalis, the litany
        of the poor and children from the church of the blessed
        martyr Cecilia". Vita S. Gregorii a Joanne Diacono, lib. 1,
        c. 42. That the litanies were recited on holy-saturday
        appears from several ancient <i>rites</i> quoted by Marlene
        (De Ant. Eccl. Ritibus, lib. 4, c. XXV, and lib. 1, c. I,
        art. 18). Palmer, wishing to defend the liturgy of the
        church of England, maintains the antiquity of litanies, but
        pretends that the invocations of saints were not originally
        contained in them, but were added to them in the west about
        the eighth century (vol. I, p. 289). From a passage in
        Walafridus Strabo he is led to admit that at <i>his</i>
        time (the ninth century) "these invocations must have been
        <i>for some time</i> in use, and accordingly manuscript
        litanies containing invocations have been discovered by
        learned men, which appear from internal evidence to be as
        old as the eighth century". He attempts however by
        <i>negative</i> arguments to shew, that these invocations
        are not more ancient than that period; although at the same
        time he confesses that "we have no <i>distinct account</i>
        of the <i>nature</i> of the service which was used on
        occasions of peculiar supplication during the earliest
        ages". p. 272. To his arguments we may oppose the
        <i>positive</i> testimony of Walafridus Strabo, who says
        "The litany of the holy names is believed to have come into
        use after Jerome, following Eusebius of Cesarea, had
        composed the martyrology". A long time, about three
        centuries, elapsed before the <i>canon</i> of the
        scriptures was determined; and it is not therefore
        surprising if the <i>canon</i> of saints, (if such it may
        be called), who died at considerable intervals, required
        some time for its formation. Invocations of the saints in
        ancient litanies may be seen ap. Martene (lib. 4f c. 27 and
        lib. 1, c. 1, art. 18). One would conceive from Palmer's
        account of the Ambrosian litany that it did not contain
        invocations of the saints, p. 276; yet in the Ambrosian
        processional, to which he alludes, we read as follows
        "Afterwards they go to the altar, were the litanies are
        recited on bended knees, in reciting which the <i>names of
        the saints</i> without <i>Intercede pro nobis</i> are sung
        aloud by the provost and clergy of the first collegiate
        church; and by the other clergy with <i>Intercede pro
        nobis</i> and this rite of singing the <i>litanies</i> and
        antiphons is observed in every other stational church". ap.
        Martene lib. 4, c. 28. In the Ordo Romanus also De
        Benedictione Ecclesiæ these invocations are found. The
        question however concerning their antiquity <i>in the
        litanies</i> is of minor importance. Even Palmer admits,
        that "Catholic fathers in the 4th century invoked the
        saints" p. 292, though he gravely assures his readers, that
        "they were too well instructed in the Christian faith to
        believe positively that the saints heard our prayers". He
        mentions the learned work of Serrarius called "Litaneutici
        seu de Litaniis etc." as an instance of the writings, in
        which "innumerable passages have been cited from ancient
        writers to prove, that the invocation of saints is more
        ancient than the eighth century. But most of those passages
        do not refer to the invocation of saints, but to prayers
        made to God for the intercession of saints". Palmer, vol.
        I, p. 278. We consider that there is little difference in
        principle between these two things: we shall however, to
        satisfy him, quote only one passage from an ancient
        Oriental liturgy. "Mother of our Lord Jesus Christ, pray
        for me to the only begotten Son, who was born of thee, that
        he may forgive me my offences and sins, and may receive
        from my feeble and sinful hands this sacrifice, which in my
        weakness I offer on this altar, through thy intercession
        for me, O holy Mother". (From the ancient liturgy used by
        the Nestorians called the liturgy of the holy apostles.
        Renaudot, t. II. See bishop Poynter's Christianity, Note E:
        and ancient inscriptions in Rock's Hierurgia, p. 347 and
        foll.) Though we have the <i>innumerable ancient</i>
        passages above-mentioned in favour of the Catholic
        doctrine, yet shall we call Mr. Palmer's attention to the
        following passage of his own work. Speaking of secrecy, he
        says: "this primitive discipline is sufficient to account
        for the fact, that very few allusions to the liturgy or
        eucharistic service are found in the writings of the
        Fathers". I, p. 14. His fears of <i>heresy and
        blasphemy</i> arising from the invocation of Saints may be
        calmed by the simple perusal of the doctrine of the church
        taught by the Council of Trent, sess. 25. "The holy synod
        commands all bishops and other teachers&mdash;<i>diligently
        to instruct the faithful, teaching them</i> that the Saints
        reigning with Christ offer to God their prayers for men;
        that it is <i>good and useful</i> to invoke them with
        supplication, and to have recourse to their prayers, help,
        and assistance, in order to obtain benefits <i>from God

        <p>We shall say nothing of sculptured figures taken from
        the catacombs, such as the statues of the good shepherd and
        S. Hippolitus now in the Vatican, or the numerous bas
        reliefs on Christian sarcophagi (on which see
        Raoul-Rochette, Tableau des Catacombes, c. IV. Beschreibung
        der Stadt Rom. B. 2, in the description of the Christian
        Museum in the Vatican Library). On another class of
        Christian representations the reader may consult
        Buonarruoti's <i>Osservazioni sopra alcuni frammenti di
        vetro, ornati di figure</i>. We shall rather call the
        attention of the Christian antiquarian to the numerous
        frescoes painted in the chapels of the catacombs, and
        illustrated by Bosio, Bottari, d'Agincourt etc., the latter
        of whom attributes some of them to the second century on
        account of the similarity of their style to that of
        frescoes in the tomb of the Nasones, which is situated on
        the Flaminian way at a short distance from Rome; his
        opinion is confirmed by the fact that some of them have
        been broken through, with the view of preparing a place of
        burial for the bodies of martyrs slain in <i>subsequent
        persecutions</i>. A list of their subjects which are
        <i>generally</i> taken from the old and new Testaments may
        be seen in Raoul-Rochette (c. 3, p. 157 foll. ed. de
        Brusselles). Of these we may briefly notice in particular
        some of the representations of Christ, of the B. Virgin, of
        the apostles and martyrs. In them Christ sometimes appears
        as an infant on the lap of His holy mother, Who ever pure
        and modest is always veiled; and this lovely group is found
        not only on these paintings, but also on bas-reliefs and
        glass-vessels generally anterior to the 4th century, and
        consequently to the general council of Ephesus held in 431;
        although it is pretended that such figures were first
        designed after that period. (Instances are enumerated by
        Raoul-Rochette c. VI). Constantina, daughter of
        Constantine, whose tomb is still preserved at Rome, begged
        of Eusebius bishop of Cesarea a likeness of our Divine
        Saviour (Concil. Labbe. t. VII, 493 seq): we must have
        recourse to the catacombs for His most ancient portraits.
        See one resembling the ordinary type of His sacred head and
        taken from the cemetery of Calixtus, at the end of
        Raoul-Rochette's work. This type, repeated again and again
        on Christian monuments during the last sixteen hundred
        years or more, may suggest the hope that some traces of our
        Divine Saviour's features are still preserved among us,
        notwithstanding the diversity of His portraits, of which S.
        Augustine complained, De Triniti l. 8, c, 4 5.
        Raoul-Rochette's opinion, that this likeness and the
        portraits of the apostles were of Gnostic origin, is
        altogether unsupported, as the Belgian editors of his work
        justly observe. Christ is frequently represented also as
        seated amid His apostles, of whom SS. Peter and Paul were
        favourite subjects of the old artists: see Raoul-Rochette
        c. VI, where he mentions, after the older antiquaries, the
        ancient representations of S. Ciriaca, S Priscilla, SS.
        Stephen, Cyprian, Laurence, Agnes, and other martyrs.
        During Diocletian's persecution, the provincial council of
        Eliberis in Spain decreed, that there should be no
        paintings on the walls of churches: its 36th canon was
        evidently intended to save sacred pictures from the
        profanations perpetrated by the pagans. The faithful
        however, fertile in expedients to gratify their devotion,
        now began to use those portable representations of pious
        subjects called diptychs, because they generally consisted
        of two tablets which could at pleasure be <i>folded</i>
        together. They were formed of ivory or wood, and resembled
        the presents of that name formerly sent by the consuls on
        the day of their entrance into office: on these were
        usually inscribed the names and the portraits of the new
        magistrates. (Symmachus lib. 2, ep. 80, all 71). The sacred
        diptychs, of which many are preserved in the Vatican
        Library, were easily saved from the fury of the
        Iconoclasts. Their folding form without their portability
        is preserved in many of the ancient altar-pieces of Italian
        and other churches and from them the modern altar-pieces
        are derived: they did not however supersede the use of
        frescoes, or mosaics, as is evident from innumerable
        ancient and modern ecclesiastical monuments of this city.
        In the preceding chapter we laid before our readers the
        doctrine of the catholic church concerning respect paid to
        images, p. 80.</p>

        are not said, in order to signify the silence of the holy
        women returning from the sepulchre (Mark XVI, 8). Others
        attribute some of these omissions to the circumstance, that
        there is no communion; on this day, and therefore neither
        offertory or postcommunion; anciently however communion was

        first introduced into the liturgy by Pope Sergius A.D. 688
        (lib. Pont.), whereas the Mass of the day is of greater

        <p>"Some form of admission to the class of catechumens was
        used in all churches at an early period, and it seems most
        commonly to have consisted of imposition of hands with
        prayers for the person. To this in many places were added
        various rites, such as, signing the forehead of the
        candidate with the cross, the consecration and giving of
        salt, which was entitled the sacrament of catechumens,
        repeated exorcisms, or prayers and adjurations to cast out
        the power of Satan, anointing with oil, and other mystical
        and figurative rites. In the course of many ages, when the
        Christian church had overspread the face of the world, and
        infidelity had become in most places extinct, the form of
        admission to the class of catechumens was from a veneration
        for old customs in many places conjoined to the office of
        baptism, and administered at the same time with it to the
        candidates for that sacrament whether they were infants or

        <p>"It has been customary in the Christian church from the
        most remote period, for the candidates for baptism to
        renounce the devil and all his works, before they were
        admitted to that sacrament. This renunciation was always
        followed by a profession of faith in Christ, as it is now
        in the English liturgy. The last interrogation and answer
        "Vis baptizari, Volo" have long been used in the west.
        (Martene de Antiq. Eccl. rit. tom. I, p. 180, 192).
        According to the ancient custom of the Roman church,
        represented in the Sacramentary of Gregory, the profession
        of faith occurs between the hallowing of the water and the
        administration of the sacrament. This custom has long been
        used in the Roman church; since the Sacramentary of
        Gelasius (A.D. 494) appointed the confession of faith to be
        made immediately before baptism, <i>though the
        renunciations were made some hours before</i>. In primitive
        times the sign of the cross was not only made on the
        forehead of the elect at the time of baptism, but was used
        very often in other ways: this act is probably not more
        recent than the apostolical age; and this sign was made in
        some part of almost every Christian office. The
        administration of baptism was succeeded by various rites in
        the primitive church; among other the newly-baptised were
        clothed in white garments. Formerly also confirmation
        followed immediately after baptism". I have extracted the
        preceding passages from different sections of Palmer's 5th
        chapter, vol. 2: coming from a clergyman of the church of
        England, they are important admissions, and they dispense
        with the necessity of my proving the antiquity of these
        various baptismal riles. The reader may see proofs of them
        collected in Palmer (loc. cit.) Martene T. 1: cap. 2,

        <p>Palmer says, that in confirmation, to the rites of
        prayer and imposition, of hands was added "that of
        anointing with an unguent or chrism, made of oil and
        balsam, and hallowed by the prayers of the bishop.&mdash;We
        learn from the writings of Tertullian and Origen, that it
        was already customary both in the east and the west at the
        end of the 2nd or beginning of the 3rd century. This chrism
        was intended to signify the grace of the Holy Spirit then
        conferred". Palmer, Or. Lit. vol. 2, p. 199. If this
        unction had not been of apostolic origin, it would not have
        been customary in all churches at so early a period.</p>

    <h2>APPENDIX</h2>

    <h3>PECULIAR CEREMONIES OF HOLY-WEEK AT JERUSALEM</h3>

    <p>Having spoken of the blessing of the paschal candle at Rome,
    we may for a few moments turn our thoughts towards a city still
    more ancient, and trodden by holier and more exalted beings
    than even the apostles and martyrs of the eternal city. The
    justly-celebrated traveller John Thevenot in his Voyage du
    Levant describes the ceremonies of holyweek performed at
    Jerusalem; the distribution of palms, the washing of the feet
    on Maunday-Thursday at the door of the holy Sepulchre; and the
    procession to the holy places or stations performed by the
    Catholic Christians. Concerning this the eloquent Pere Abbé de
    Geramb, in his interesting Pelerinage at Jerusalem in 1832,
    informs us that "by means of a figure in relief of the natural
    size, whose head, arms, and feet are flexible, the religious
    represent the crucifixion, the descent from the cross, and the
    burial of Jesus Christ, in such manner as to render all the
    principal circumstances apparent to the senses and
    striking".</p>

    <p>Both these distinguished writers of different periods agree
    in testifying, that all the devotions of the Catholics were and
    are still conducted with so much order that they are admired
    both by Christians and Turks, whereas those of the schismatical
    Christians took place with much confusion, and with such a
    noise, that the Janissaries, who had to preserve order, were
    obliged to strike the persons engaged in them as well as the
    spectators. This statement is confirmed by the account, which
    they and other travellers give, of the <i>holy fire</i> of the
    Greeks and other schismatics. Benedict XIV observes that no
    mention is made of the supposed miracle of the holy fire by
    early Christian writers who lived at Jerusalem; as Eusebius, S.
    Jerome, S. Epiphanius, or S. Cyril bishop of
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page122"
       id="page122"></a>[pg 122]</span> Jerusalem. It is however
       spoken of by Bernard a Frank monk of the ninth century, and
       in a Pontifical of the church of Poictiers of about the
       tenth century: by Hugo Flaviniacensis in Chronico
       Virdunensi, in the discourse of Urban II in the council of
       Claremont, and in other documents of the middle ages
       mentioned by Martene (lib. IV, c. XXIV). Lupi (tom. 4, Conc.
       gen. etc.) thinks it probable, that the custom of burning
       lights and the paschal candle on this day was instituted, in
       order to return thanks to God for a miracle (which
       <i>may</i> of old have happened at Jerusalem) and to
       announce it to all nations.</p>

    <p>I shall now extract a brief account of the scene of
    confusion enacted in modern times at Jerusalem on such
    occasions from Thevenot, in whose work is a print representing
    it. "After our Catholic office was ended" says he, "we prepared
    to enjoy the sight of the holy fire of the Greeks, Armenians
    and Copts, whose priests make their people believe, that on
    holy Saturday fire descends from heaven into the holy
    Sepulchre, and on that account make each of their pilgrims, who
    are very numerous, pay some money. This solemnity appears
    rather a comedy or a farce than a church-ceremony, and is very
    unbecoming in a place so sacred as the holy Sepulchre. After we
    had finished our service, which was about eight in the morning,
    they, extinguished all their lamps and those of the holy
    Sepulchre, and then they commenced their folly, running round
    the holy Sepulchre, like mad people, crying, howling, <i>et
    faisans un bruit de diables</i>; it was charming to see them
    running one after another, kicking and striking one another
    with cords; many of them together held men in their arms, and
    going round the holy Sepulchre, let them fall, and then raised
    horrible shouts of laughter, while they who had fallen ran
    after the others to avenge themselves: it seemed that both old
    and young were downright mad. From time to time they raised
    their eyes, and stretched their hands, full of taper, to
    heaven, <span class="pagenum"><a name="page123"
       id="page123"></a>[pg 123]</span> crying all together
       <i>eleison</i>, as if they were wearied at the delay of the
       holy fire. This scene continued till towards three in the
       evening, when two Greek archbishops and two bishops habited
       as patriarchs, for the patriarch was not then at Jerusalem,
       left their choir with all their clergy, and began the
       procession round the holy Sepulchre: they were joined by the
       Armenians, four of whom wore mitres: then came a Coptic
       bishop, with all his clergy and people. After they had
       walked three times round the holy Sepulchre, a Greek priest
       came out of the chapel of the Angel, which is close to that
       of the holy Sepulchre, and gave notice to him who
       represented the Patriarch, that the holy fire had descended
       from heaven: the latter then entered into the holy
       Sepulchre, followed by the representatives of the Armenian
       patriarch and of the Coptic bishop. After they had remained
       there a short time, we saw the Greek archbishop in an
       amusing posture, bending down his head, and bearing in each
       hand a quantity of lighted tapers. No sooner had he
       appeared, than all rushed one upon another to light their
       tapers from those of the archbishop; as that is considered
       the best fire, which is first lighted. The Janissaries
       however, who were stationed near the door of the chapel of
       the Angel, did not stand with their arms folded, but made
       the calpacs and turbans of the Greeks fly from one end of
       the church to the other, striking around on all sides with
       their sticks, to make way for the poor archbishop, who also
       as we may suppose did all in his power to save himself. He
       then mounted in haste a stone-altar opposite the entrance of
       the holy Sepulchre, where he was immediately surrounded by
       the people: those also who had lighted their tapers
       endeavouring to save themselves were overwhelmed by the
       others: the confusion was horrible, and blows were not
       unfrequent. After the Greek archbishop has come out, the
       Armenian appears, and saves himself from the crowd in the
       church of the Armenians, and the Copt in that of the Copts.
       Every <span class="pagenum"><a name="page124"
       id="page124"></a>[pg 124]</span> one was in such a hurry to
       get some of the holy fire, that in a moment more than 2000
       bundles of candles flamed in the church: and the people,
       crying out like persons possessed began greater follies than
       before. A man carrying a drum on his back began to run with
       all his might round the holy Sepulchre, and another running
       in the same manner struck it with two sticks; and when he
       was tired, another immediately took his place. "<i>Il semble
       qu' on soit dans un enfer, et que ce soient tout autant de
       diables déchainès</i>."&mdash;But enough of this unedifying
       scene, of which the Abbé Geramb gives a similar account. If
       we contrast with it the majestic and edifying ceremonies of
       the Roman church, we shall feel grateful to God for having
       preserved us from such disorders. I shall merely add from
       Thevenot, that the Christians are called to office at the
       holy Sepulchre by boards struck with iron, as we are for two
       days in holy-week: but drums and other instruments are also
       played there, which make, he (adds), "une musique
       enragée".</p>

    <p>The distinguished missionary and pilgrim D. Casto Gonzalez
    recounts other disorders of the Greeks during Holy Week, and
    profanations of the most holy sanctuaries of Palestine. In the
    year 1833 he exposed, but not without great risk, the fraud of
    the "holy fire". On the holy-Saturday of the Greeks the
    officiating Bishop accompanied by an Armenian and a Coptic
    Bishop and their respective clergy had already walked thrice
    round the holy Sepulchre, when the missionary ignited a match
    with phosphorus, and holding it up exclaimed "Look, the
    heavenly fire has fallen into my hands": he then extinguished
    it and lighted it again several times to the great astonishment
    of the assembled multitude. He was protected by the Turks from
    the dangers which surrounded him. So manifest was the fraud of
    the pretended "holy fire" that even the schismatical Armenian
    patriarch issued a circular
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page125"
       id="page125"></a>[pg 125]</span> letter forbidding his
       spiritual subjects to be present at the disgraceful
       exhibition.</p>

    <p>The Pere Abbé de Geramb gives a glowing account of the
    Catholic service and mass on holy saturday; and we most warmly
    recommend to our readers the perusal of the 34th <i>Lettre</i>
    of his <i>Pelerinage</i>, in which he describes all the
    ceremonies of holy week at Jerusalem, where they are invested
    with the peculiar charm arising from spots so sacred, where
    Christ suffered, and died, and rose again. Though in other
    respects the Roman ceremonies are of a more exalted nature, yet
    here must we be contented to transport ourselves in imagination
    to those beloved sanctuaries, and to see the
    <i>representation</i> of the holy Sepulchre at S. Maria
    Egiziaca. We shall conclude with the words of the distinguished
    writer: "Jamais douleur n'affecta plus vivement mon àme, que
    celle qui s'en empara au moment où je m'arrachai pour jamais de
    l'église du saint Sepulcre. Taut que je vivrai elle sera aussi
    présente à mon esprit que profondément gravée dans mon coeur;
    toujours souvenir me fera tressaillir, parce que toujours, et
    plus qu' aucun autre souvenir, il me rappellera Jésus, crucifié
    pour mon salut, pour la salut du genre humain, à l'amour duquel
    nous devons repondre par le plus vif, le plus tendre, le plus
    absolu de tous les amours; ce Jésus auquel je dois l'ineffable
    bonheur de comprendre, de sentir cette grande verité, que je
    voudrais faire comprendre et sentir a l'univers entier, que lui
    seul est tout, que tout ce qui n'est pas lui, n'est rien, n'est
    que neant". Pelerinage à Jerusalem, Lett. 36.</p>

works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
